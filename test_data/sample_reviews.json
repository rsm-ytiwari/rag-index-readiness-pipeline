This Jack or Jill of all trades implied that they determine how much help they'll need on any given night, they said that on this night they asked the additional help to not come in. So, this is not a case of not being able to find willing workers (big problem everywhere it seems). Frankly, I'd have been far more comfortable not having to watch this person bustle around doing everything...which they DID manage beautifully.\n\nFor whatever reason we were having an extremely difficult time deciding what we wanted, no fault of a limited menu, there was plenty to choose from- even for a pescatarian like myself. The server said they are known for their Mac and cheese with shaved brussel sprouts (app). It was indeed next level but was also a tad salty.

I am only giving this museum 4 stars because I love him and his work so much. However, I am not a huge fan of this museum. I visited the old Dali museum in St Pete probably 7 or 8 years ago. I was blown away! After admiring  his works in books for years, it was so surreal (pun intended) to see them in person. Then in 2004, I decided to go visit his 3 museums (teatro-museo, Gala's castle and the Port Lligat home) in Spain. If you are a true admirer of Dali, nothing can compare to seeing the landscapes that inspired his works and the home environments that he created! \n\nWhen I heard all the buzz around the new Dali opening in St Pete, I decided I needed to make another trip from Indy down to Florida with the main purpose being to visit the museum. There seemed to be a lot of hype around the building itself and so I was excited to see it's architecture and explore this new home created to house this impressive collection. I think my expectations were too high. Yes, the exterior side of the museum with the glass is really cool and unique, both inside and out. And the spiral staircase inside seems very Dali-esque. \n\nOther than the glass wall & staircase, the interior of the museum feels so stark, sterile and not like it was inspired by Dali in anyway. This is very disappointing to me. I would give the plain white walls and overall boring interior 1 star. Maybe the creators wanted it to be a simple backdrop that wouldn't compete with Dali's works for visitors' attention, but to me... it was a huge letdown. Perhaps I had anticipated that this building, designed with Dali and his paintings in mind, was going to somehow echo the theater museum that he had created in Figueres... one giant surrealist creation designed as a home for many more of his works. This was not the case. \n\nThe sterile environment does not do Dali proud, in my opinion. While I would encourage admirers of Dali or even someone unfamiliar with him who happens to be in the area to visit the museum, I am personally not in any hurry to return. I will just save up my money for a plane ticket to Barcelona and make my way north, next time the Dali bug bites me! :)", "date": "2011-04-22 17:08:42"}

Maybe because the walls were covered with wall mirrors to enhance the size. There was no one at the counter, but my date and I decided to sit at a table.  I normally don't like tables at AYCE sushi because I feel the chef skips on ingredients in the roll or makes a completely different roll than what I ordered.\n\nWe started out with seaweed salad (like always), edamame and crab rangoon.  These were very good and well made, so I thought the sushi would be the same and I was excited...my first roll was the Orange Blossom - it looked nothing like the picture displayed and the scallops were uncooked and slimy and loaded on top - yuck.  Other places like the Atlantis and Hiroba cook the scallops and put it on the roll, but these were slimy and smelly, I didn't want to finish.  The quality of the fish seemed very cheap, especially on my next roll which was pictured as the Kietzke roll - when she put it on the table, I said \"is this the Kietzke, it looks nothing like the picture\"?  And she told me the pictures always vary.  There was no sauce on it and the color of the seared salmon looked a little gray.  There was also supposed to be cilantro in this roll and there was none what-so-ever.  I decided to order one more roll to see if they can even come close to making a good one, I ordered the Big Hill or Hill Big roll and my date ordered the Mountain roll.  When they brought the two together, they were identical twins.  I guess a big hill is basically a mountain, but my goodness we couldn't find one difference except I ordered mine with tobiko.  In other words, the sushi chef made two rolls exactly the same, threw tobiko on one and called it gross. we ended up putting plates on top because we couldn't bring ourselves to finish.  Not to mention, I found a piece of plastic (probably from the wrapping of the fish - no big) in one of my bites.  And one more thing that was bothersome, there were flies everywhere.  I noticed one landing on the edamame, then my roll, then my dessert.  They only had one mochi strawberry left, so I was stuck with mango.  No one could pay me to go back there, I hate paying $21 + tip for crappy sushi when I could have gone somewhere much better for $25.  I'm glad I tried it to add to my Reno sushi adventures, however this place gets 2 out of 5 stars from me.  Sorry Kitzmo.", "date": "2013-07-07 22:17:52"}

It has been consistently good until recently. I went back just few days ago and all I can say is they have reduced the portions of their servings. I know how big their pizzettas and tiramisu servings were and now they are much smaller. When I asked the server why, he said they still use the same amount of dough in the pizzetta but probably it was made thicker so it's smaller. Well, if that is the case, it is still smaller because they use less toppings when the circumference is smaller. When the tiramisu came out, again I was surprised to see how much smaller it is. When I asked again, they said it's still the same size, just cut differently. Seriously, they are bluffing. It would have been better if they wanted to make more money to charge more but keep the serving size the same. As a loyal customer, I come here all the time expecting whatever I ordered before to be the same, but now, I don't know what else they \"downsized.\" And oh yes, the Tartufo Funghi used to have more Tartufo flavor to it. Now, it's a red pizza and they might as well just have called it Funghi (mushroom) pizza as there is hardly tartufo smell and flavor to it! It used to be a lot better. Probably will no longer go back. Too bad as it used to be my and my family's  \"default\" place to be.", "date": "2013-02-12 01:23:28"}

The experience was disappointing and I will not recommend this location to any parents in the future. Here is a breakdown of the issues encountered. We had a voucher slip purchased at Groupon which allowed for five visits. The day we visited, was on the MLK holiday. As soon as we entered the facility and presented our voucher, we were told they did not honor coupons on holidays. This is actually on their site, but is hidden in the calendar to the point where you have to click on the actual time and date your planning your visit to see the disclaimer (this is a bad sign when you hide your policy). This was also not on their door or their answering machine. I guess they had so many angry questions about this that they scribbled a make shift sign and taped it to their door, I saw it as I left the place.\n\nNo problem, I paid for the current visit and also redeemed my voucher for future use.  The injury disclaimer I had signed was never verified against any identification, I could have put any name down and nothing was checked (another bad sign when issues of legality are glossed over). Upon entering the facility I was surprised to see that they were very crowded and had only three high school age attendants monitoring the inflatable bounce slides. One young attendant was sitting inside the ride with a dazed look while children pushed and shoved each other, while I was there this attendant never once intervened. The second pair of attendants was standing together in another ride. These two were more engrossed in their teeny bopper conversation than what was going on around them.  The facility is actually smaller then what you would expect for a place like this and it was really crowded. In the corners of the facility were disassembled slides and some of the air generators. Instead of being stored away or roped off from the kids, they were on the floor as potential tripping hazards. \n\nSome of the slides had a cushioned pillow to absorb the impact, others did not. The overcrowded bouncing palace was also not monitored despite the sign that stated kids should not enter unless supervised. One of the younger kids left the bouncing palace crying because she was getting hit in the face by an older boy, yet the attendants kept gabbing away. This pandemonium occurred with younger visitors being bullied, blocked, and pushed by older ones. This could have been easily remedied if the attendants split up and did their jobs more effectively, or just did their jobs. Eventually, and after the child we were with got shoved and pushed by older kids, I decided we would not stay the full time we paid for. As we left I returned the unused vouchers and asked for my Groupon receipt back. I would rather get my money back from Groupon (and risk not getting a refund) then visit this poor location again.", "date": "2015-01-20 17:06:10"}

Check Wikipedia for more info. Their Doner Kebab article has a huge subsection on \"Regional Variations,\" with several paragraphs specifically dedicated to Germany. Here are a couple interesting highlights:\n\nEven orders placed in the Turkish language in Berlin will ask for the hot sauce using the German word \"scharf\", flagging the hybrid nature of the Berlin style of d\u00f6ner kebap. This variation served with pita bread has influenced the style of d\u00f6ner kebap in Germany and in other nations. A 2007 survey showed that many people consider the d\u00f6ner kebab to be the most characteristic food of Berlin.\n\nAnnual sales of d\u00f6ner kebabs in Germany amounted to \u20ac2.5 billion in 2010... Tarkan Ta\u015fyumruk, president of the Association of Turkish D\u00f6ner Producers in Europe (ATDID), provided information in 2010 that, every day, more than 400 tonnes of d\u00f6ner kebab meat is produced in Germany by around 350 firms.", "date": "2018-01-02 22:22:48"}

We went there around lunch time and the restaurant was extremely busy, perhaps border line chaotic.  \n\nJoe mama's is not exactly a nice sit down place, but closer to a fast food breakfast/brunch place.  Without judging, I did not hesitate to place my order of southwest eggs benedict with home fries, which I was told it was one of their famous dishes.  My mom, on the other hand, ordered pulled pork sandwich.   After placing our order at the cashier, we looked for un-occupied table but all the tables were either taken or hadn't been cleaned yet.  However, soon after we set our stuff on a bench right next to a table, one of their waitresses came by to clear the table for us.\n\nAs time passed by, we were still sipping away on our water.  Our stomachs were demanding food as we both did not have anything for breakfast.  Finally after more than half an hour, the food finally came.  I took my first bite and I wonder how long my food had been sitting and waiting to be served.  My eggs benedict was cold and disgusting.  The cornbread was soggy - not eatable, and don't get me started on the home fries.  For a moment, I thought I could taste the nastiness from freezer burn.  All the sudden, my appetite was gone and I was done with my meal after waiting for my food for nearly 40 minutes.\n\nI did try my mom's pulled pork sandwich and it was alright.  The bbq sauce tasted like it was straight from a bottle.  There was absolutely nothing special about that dish but it sure seemed to be popular since I see them on almost every single table across the restaurant.\n\nAs I was waiting for my mom to finish her meal, a waitress came by and asked if we got their complimentary hot cakes because they had messed up on the order their pulled pork sandwiches had come out.  After waiting for another five minutes, the hot cakes never came and I had given up.\n\nFrom my first and my last visit, I would give Joe mama's a one-star rating.  There is nothing special about their food; in fact I find their food less than OK.  There are definitely other places out there that serve better and eatable breakfast and perhaps even cheaper.

And after the service, we didn't get a report on the state of the battery that we got from a previous, wonderful Mitsubishi dealer in GA. \n\nDuring the replacement of the tires, they estimated 90 minutes, so I went away for 3 1/2 hours and asked for them to charge the car after they were done. I don't know if they waited until the last minute to start or whatever, but the car was just done after the 3 1/2 hours and the car when I got in was at a 6 mile range, so I couldn't even drive it home.  They needed to drive the car after installing the tires and check alignment, which is normal, but the heat was on high, AC on and fan on full -- not a great combo for saving any battery range. \n\nSo I'm back here waiting another hour to have enough range to get home and probably never come back.", "date": "2016-12-07 18:44:55"}

Well, the debate is over. R2L is not worth a revisit. Unless, you're newly single and looking to impress a new date. And another new date. And another new date.\n\nFood. Another Restaurant Week, a new menu. Same dessert. My favorite part was the dessert last time, so I'm glad they kept that the same! The fried risotto balls were OK. It was like a grown-up version of fried cheese balls you can get at a dive bar, but with risotto. The poached and fried chicken, which looked almost exactly like the Chicken Picnic, were both just OK. The portions were extremely small. The chicken was cooked well, but lacked seasoning. Celery didn't add much to the dish, but to me, actually took away from the dish. It didn't have a place on the plate. It added a separate texture that didn't connect with the dish. The lobster mac and cheese was wack. The bechamel, although very creamy, was not flavorful. For the different types of cheeses used in the bechamel, it lacked saltiness.\n\nDrinks. For a lounge that boasts some of the best views in Philly, you would think the drinks should be up to par, especially for the hefty price tags. Apparently, you're just paying for the view, not for the quality of drinks. I would think R2L would have some legitimate mixologists, especially with the fancy cocktails they have on the menu. But every drink either had too much liquor or not enough. You were either taking alcohol to the face in the form of a cocktail or you were sipping on soda with a splash of liquor. A meager splash.\n\nService. For a place so well-staffed, man... service was hecka slow. Dinner took 2.5 hours, so plan accordingly. This doesn't include our appetizer order while waiting at the bar. Include that, then the dinner from beginning to end was closer to 3 hours. Our dishes were not laid in front of the right people at our table, not a big deal. A beer was delivered to our table that was not ordered. Our appetizer was incorrect. And at least two glasses, at different times, were broken during dinner.

From management to falling door knobs to noisy neighbors. The manager Amy Detwiler is a racist, she would cater to white residents and ignored the complaints of minority residents. As a  pregnant woman with chronic headaches, I made MULTIPLE noise complaints and nothing was resolved instead I was told to go and speak to the neighbor myself. The walls are super thin and you can hear everything from your neighbor but also the people walking by in the hall way. The yoga room computer screen was broken for about 4 months, two machines in the gym were non operational, the printer they provide residents NEVER worked while I was there and there was not enough shopping carts for the residents to bring in groceries. The trash room door handle was broken for weeks and when they came to fix it all they did was put tape over it. They sell you this apartment to be luxury but it is really just a front, the appliances are cheap and there is an ant infestation. The washer/dryer all in one takes 7 hours and ruins ALL your clothes, it's a disaster I had to begin going to a laundry mat to say the rest of my clothes. Multiple times when I made complaints to Amy she would ignore my emails. The only person that I can say was a huge help was Courtney. Their communication SUCKS, not once was it mentioned to me that I would be charged additional outside of my deposit for cleaning fees. They charge you for EVERYTHING even after you clean and ridiculous fees that don't even make sense. I moved out of the apartment and was never informed of these additional charges, they had my phone number and email address never received ANY kind of invoice. It was not until I applied for a new apartment who reviewed my rental history and reached out to them, as many do, where they informed THEM I had an outstanding balance still remaining at their management company.

We dined here tonight for my mom's & my birthdays and absolutely one of the worst dinners we've ever had. Regulars of the Franklin location, we decided on Hendersonville since we were going to be in the area but what a mistake. \n\nTo start, we arrived at 4:00 pm when they were due to open. 10 minutes of standing in the cold, with another family past 4:00pm and circling the building, peeking into windows, we were finally let in. Another 5 minutes in the lobby waiting to be seated, music wasn't on, bar was still being stocked, salt and pepper was missing from all tables, bathrooms were empty of toilet paper and paper towels, table candles weren't on (because they are battery led not real flame, by the way Franklin has real candles, then another 10 MINUTES, no joke, for a mojito, bottled beer, and glass of wine. Let's not talk about the fact that they were completely empty on a Friday night. No wonder. There were two other tables in here the entire time we dined. \n\nSadly, we weren't the only ones with an issue, the table next to us got up several times for similar complaints. \n\nNext our server, Sydney, was nearly absent our entire visit, is unfortunately quite clumsy, spilled our chips all over our table and laps after we waited a good 5-10 minutes for them to be replenished since he brought our queso but not chips. Hard to enjoy queso while it's hot without chips. \n\nAll 4 of our entrees arrived cold, we requested salt & pepper and hot sauce at meal drop off, that didn't arrive until we were 2/3s of the way through our meal.\n\nNext to our table, there was a trip hazard, some sort of runner rug that no less than 3 people tripped over. We even overheard the manager tell the table next to us that the carpet was stained and that's why it was there. Are you kidding me? Absolutely Disgusting! \n\nAfter my dad waited 10 minutes for second beer, he finally got up and got it from the bar himself. Again, 3 tables in the place, 10 minutes a drink is unacceptable. \n\nFinally the most disappointing part, the sopapillas :( this is typically my favorite part of the meal - airy, hot, and delicious. Well not this time. Warm at best and like a brick. What?!?! How is this is even possible?!\n\nWe called over the manager to alert her of our concerns. When I mentioned the brick-like sopapillas, she continuously retorted that the dough came from the Franklin location. First of all, don't argue with a customer, and secondly your chef doesn't know how to cook them properly then. She was overall apologetic and discounted our meal but did in fact say they were under a change in management and one can only assume they will be closed soon.\n\nSad sad sad. What a terrible blemish on the outstanding reputation of Sopapillas, where we bring all of our out of town guests and celebrate. \n\nNeedless to say we won't be returning to this location but Franklin will continue to keep my business.", "date": "2016-12-30 23:51:39"}

I appreciate their affordable pricing, the two free bags, the complimentary in-flight snacks and drinks, the adult beverage vouchers, the humorous and friendly staff. However.... on the evening of 03/27/2017, I had a upsetting experience with Flight Attendant 'Suzi.' I was on Flight 1247 from PHL (Philadelphia) to Denver. Maybe she was having a rough/bad day, but her demeanor effected my travel. While in flight, as she was passing out snacks, she reach across me to offer the window seat passenger snacks. Her body and arm were blocking my access and I assumed she would offer me the snacks after the other passenger. She did not. Suzi immediately retracted the snacks, turned her back on me, and offered the other row snacks. I tapped her on her waist and advised that I would want a snack. She made a smart comment, allowed me to take two snacks, and continued on her way. Later in the flight, she took my drink order; I asked for a vodka tonic. She later returned with the drink.... only she decided to mix it herself. Now, flight attendants are not bartenders and she did not ask me how I would like to take my drink. The items should be given to the passenger so they can decide how strong or weak they would like their drink. After all, these are not free drinks and they are not made to order. Suzi poured the entire bottle of vodka in the cup and topped it off with a little tonic water; way too strong. I informed Suzi that I was not at all pleased with the drink. Her response was that I should have indicated that I wanted the entire can and bottle to make it myself. She made the drink because it was easier for her to carry, versus the carrying the small bottle, can of tonic, cup of ice, and accessories. I informed her, that of all the times I have ordered my alcoholic beverages onboard, I have always been given the can and the alcohol to mix myself, which makes sense because everyone enjoys their drinks differently. Suzi returned to my seat and slammed the open can of vodka on my tray and told me to mix additional tonic in as I drank it to weaken it and walked off. I sat in my seat for a few minutes.... shocked at her frustrating, disrespect, and her disregard. After so long, I got up out of my seat, went to the rear of the plane, place my beverage on the attendant's counter and explained that I was unsatisfied with my beverage and wished for a new one, after all, I am paying for my beverage. This was not a complementary soda. Suzi returned and again disrespectfully slammed the beverages on my tray. \n\nHowever minor as this incident may seem, it really had a negative effect on my travel. It put me in a bad mood and made me defensive when having to deal with Suzi. The interaction was unprovoked and unwarranted and at that point, made my drink unenjoyable. This one experience does not deter me from traveling with Southwest, nor will it prevent me from recommending Southwest to my family and or friends. But be reminded that as a flight attendant, they have a duty to respect others and treat everyone with dignity.", "date": "2017-03-28 15:10:29"}

The menu seemed a little overly fancy (duck confit crepes, etc), especially given that there doesn't appear to be a kitchen and everything is prepared behind the counter, so most of the ingredients are premade (at least they were in my salad).\n\nI ordered the gulf shrimp salad (it had a cute name but I forgot it), which has avocado and arugula in it. While the salad tasted really good, the presentation was kind of strange. They just scooped out two avocado halves, put them on top of the arugula (which still had stems?) on a rectangular plate, and then dumped the shrimp in the avocado halves. Would it have killed them to cut up the avocado? It wasn't busy, and it just seemed like lazy food prep and presentation to me, plus the avocado was really bland because it wasn't mixed with any of the dressing on the arugula. If you're going to be high and mighty with your menu, have presentation that matches. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the prosciutto sandwich, but got speck instead because they were out of prosciutto. It seems like the speck was pretty tough, since he was having a hard time getting a solid bite and the sandwich just fell apart. They also put whole little tomatoes (cherry? grape? I'm not sure), in the sandwich instead of slicing them up, so when he bit in a tomato exploded all over both of us (including my white shirt...). It seemed like the whole tomatoes were a cute theory, but not a practical when it comes to the execution of sandwich-eating, since you can't really pop a whole one in your mouth the way you do with a salad.\n\nI did really like my chai, which is made there, so that was a plus.

Order it on wings, tenders, chicken cheesesteak, on the side with your fries- you won't be disappointed!!! 3. Make sure to leave your name on the ceiling downstairs.", "date": "2020-05-08 20:37:36"}

We travel to many vineyards and wineries all over PA and NJ, and DiBella was by far one of our absolute favorites. We arrived there about 10 minutes before they opened and as soon as one of the owners saw our car pulled in, she flipped the sign to open the store just for us. We were greeted with a warm smile and the decor was welcoming-it was quaint, with beautiful woodwork and had that feeling of Home. You can tell the owners take great pride in giving their guests a personal and pleasant experience. We went for a wine tasting and Julie took care of us. She was very knowledgeable about all the subtleties that make each wine special, and answered any questions we had about the wines. The price of the tasting was one if not the least expensive we've experienced and the samples were more than ample. If we really enjoyed a certain wine, she generously offered us a second tasting--I've never had that happened in any other vineyard. We all enjoyed each of the wines we tried and the prices of the bottles were very reasonable (compared to many wineries) considering the excellent quality of the wine. We want to 4 other wineries that day and not one of them came close to the warmth and hospitality that we received there. I highly recommend visiting DiBella whether you're local or not and I would absolutely go back again for the events they host which you can learn about on their Facebook page. I generally tend to write reviews when I have unpleasant experiences, in but I felt compelled to share because Julie and her families winery was just so enjoyable, knowledgeable, wonderful, and of course tasty.

I am a regular consumer of croissants and Metropolitan almost never fails to disappoint.  Sometimes there's a bit too much egg glaze, but most often the problem is just too much butter (or that it's too unevenly rolled).  Some people might think that's a nice sign of artisanal or hand production.  I don't.  Nothing spoils a croissant like biting into a pool of butter.  The texture is bad, the taste is bad, and it makes you think the decadent treat wasn't worth it.  This has happened several times with croissants from Metropolitan.  More than is reasonable, in fact, for me to keep returning.  The first time I thought, well anyone could make a bad croissant out of thousands.  The second and third times I thought, well that's not right, but it was so close and convenient and the store seemed so well put-together I went again because I thought it had to be me -- it couldn't be this great upscale bakery's problem, could it?

However I continued to be shocked at both how good, and how bad a sandwich can be. And every time I have one of those great sandwich experiences it seems to be a total shock somehow. Really, how good could pastrami, cheese, onions, some sauce and lettuce and tomato really be? \n\nThe answer is it could be as good as it is a Country Catering. I walked into this place yesterday for the first time ever. I had read a couple good reviews and assumed it would good. But again, how good can a simple sandwich place be? I walked in as they seemed to be closing up. I was the only customer in the shop, and suspected quickly I'd be hearing, \"Sorry! Closed up for the day\". Instead, I was asked if they could get me a sandwich. I asked for pastrami with swiss cheese on a wheat roll, and suggested they surprise me with the rest. I waited and chatted with the staff about what I was doing in town, how I found the place, and finally what kind of side I would be having. I ordered macaroni salad hoping that it might in some way remind me of the macaroni salad in Hawaii (which all you mainlanders should know is way better than anything I've had stateside. And in all seriousness I still can't figure out why). But anyway. The sandwich comes out and in a funny way I wish it had taken longer. The staff was so incredibly kind and amiable, I found myself truly happy to be there. I found myself thinking that living in Goleta would be wonderful. \n\nBut now, the only thing that really matters to a review reader; THE FOOD. There can be no understatement regarding how good this sandwich was. It was everything a sandwich should be and more. The pastrami was juicy, salty, sweet and plentiful. There was no excess of condiments, and if the sandwich was \"too wet\" it was due to the copious meat drippings that were shooting down my wrists. I demolished the entire thing in no time at all. The cheese was melted, and the lettuce and tomato was crisp and fresh. But then I noticed that I still had the macaroni salad. At this point I was stuffed full of delicious sandwich and would usually have passed. But given how good the sandwich was I dove in, and Yes, I finished the entire thing. It might be some of the best macaroni salad I've had. It screamed California with olives and crunch from the celery. All ther really is to say is that is was delicious and in no way having too much mayonnaise.\n\nTo end this epic, I will tell you I returned there today for lunch, decided to try the Tri-Tip, and simply told the girl at the counter my life was in her hands and aside from the meat the rest of the decisions were up to her. Needless to say, the sandwich was, again, transcendent. \n\nSO\nin short, go to this place and spend your hard earned dollar. It couldn't go to nicer people, and you will, for your $8 or $9 get a sandwich that will shoot you over the moon and back. \n\nJust go. If you don't know where to get a bite in Santa Barbara for lunch, GO HERE.", "date": "2012-03-02 23:03:25"}

I told her about the hours online and she said that was the other stores hours and it must've been a mistake on Apple Maps.\nThe food and drink were great and I still am so impressed with how well they handled what's usually a very annoying situation. Thank you, Isabelle, and the staff in the back making food. I apologize for the misunderstanding on hours but I really appreciate how kind all of you were.", "date": "2021-10-20 21:55:52"}

Although my business with this establishment had nothing to do with heating or cooling or whatever else they claim to be. They posted an amazing 31ft trailer on an app for 1550. It said the trailer needed some work. I left the seller, we'll call her R, a message on said app. She then reached back with her phone number. I responded and said I will get back to you around noon. Time got away from me, but I heard my phone message alert and it was an OfferUp message. After opening the message it said the price dropped to 1100. I called immediately! R and I made tentative plans to bring money. R also stated she will sell said trailer for 800. Well that got me on my horse and I was on my way to this business. She called and broke my heart and said another guy got there first. But if something happens, I'll be the first person she would call. 2 hours later R calls again letting me know the trailer was mine. The guy couldn't pick it up until the next day. I immediately used the U-haul App for obvious reasons. After renting the truck, I reached out via text to seller to ask for zip code and another text for hitch size on trailer. Just to make sure all i's were dotted and all t's crossed. I was on my way to Wilmington from south Jersey,  about an hour away. I was so excited to finally have something to repurpose. After arriving  at this meeting place, I called seller, no answer. I texted, no response. Waited, then realized there was another trailer on the property. I looked at the trailer but wasn't the one I was coming to get. I turned around and seen the trailer from the app being towed to this property. I thought he was bringing it down to me. A man drove up to me with a very curt tone and told me to move that thing out the way. Meaning the brand new GMC I had rented. He gets out of his truck and says \"my wife didn't call you?\" I say \"hello, how are you?\" I talked to her about an hour ago. He says, well it's gone. The guy came back with 1000. Now... I'm not upset that the trailer was sold to the highest bidder, I'm upset that R knew I was travelling a distance and wasted money on a rental for nothing. What is interesting is that the husband asked how much I had to try to sell me another trailer. I told that poor excuse of a business owner  \" sir, I would never do business with you.\" That explains the piss poor reviews about how they conduct business. I'm so sorry I didn't read the reviews as I do with any business I visit. But I felt inclined because people need to be aware of shady characters. I've been in business as a stylist for about 20 years. It's no way I can let anyone leave my chair disappointed.", "date": "2018-07-28 16:01:11"}

But it's clearly catering to the 21 and under crowd and making those of us who are over 21 pay extra for simply wanting to drink while we enjoy a performance.  \n\nWent for some concert (I can't even remember the headliner honestly cause the whole experience was so bad) on a Saturday night and was expecting to pay $25 for the ticket.  Get to the front and was told if I wanted to go to the 21 and over section, it would be $55.  Oh, did I mention it's BYOB?  And that extra 30 dollars means 30 dollars for you to store your ALREADY BOUGHT alcohol on a shelf at an empty no-liquor-license bar?  I didn't even have alcohol in my hand but a friend in front of me had a case of beer with him.  I guess assuming people are going to drink cause their friends are is grounds for charging me an extra 30 fucking dollars.  I could have just said \"Oh, I'll go to the 21 and under section, then\" but security made it clear that I'd be stuck over there in that section:  I literally would not be allowed to visit my friends in the 21-over section to escape for a bit, regardless of my ID that says I'm over 21.  I paid the stupid $55 cover for a wristband and went to the 21 and over section, now in a sour mood.\n\nWhen I first got there, it was so dark and I couldn't figure out where the hell I was going, but soon made sense of everything.  There was actually a really nice bottle service section (how much do they charge for that if you bring your own bottle, I wonder?)  but if I paid for it, I'd be pissed cause it was not exclusive at all.  Anyone and everyone could just saunder on through and block your already-shitty view of the DJ booth.\n\nFriend had to give his beer to some \"bartenders\" behind the \"bar\" so they could store it and put his name on it so whenever he wanted a beer, he'd say his name.  Not a terrible idea, except if I didn't have alcohol and paid the $55 and wanted alcohol, I could just go up to them and make up a pretty common name and get booze in return.  In addition to this, you also feel obligated to tip these \"bartenders\" because they need to make a living, too, right?  But honestly, dishing out any more cash on this place will just piss you off even more.\n\nTo the concert itself:  I couldn't even see the opening DJs because there were a million pillars in my way and though I could hear, it was really muffled.  I did get a nice view of the EDM high school dance below me, though.  When the headliner came on, we wanted to get closer, so we had to finish our beers, walk down the steps past the bouncers, then shuffle through the 15 year olds to the front to get a decent view of the stage.  Luckily, this particular show wasn't crowded so it wasn't hard to do but I can't imagine how difficult it would be to get a glimpse of someone famous, like Diplo.\n\nYou'd honestly be better off going somewhere far better, like Union Transfer.  Or hell, YouTube it and you'd get a better view of your favorite artist than SoundGarden has to offer.", "date": "2013-01-21 18:03:32"}

Now I feel like I should have written my review when I had my experience..... (and I wish this thing would allow NO start to be clicked)\n\nI moved to New Orleans in April of this year and, ONLY because I have a very good friend who is from here and knows all of the best places to go, I listened to him when he raved about getting three of the best pairs of glasses he has ever owned and he got them from this business.  He insisted that the young lady that assists patients with glasses was very thorough, very knowledgeable, and honest in her opinion.  He told me that even if I picked up the most expensive pair of frames in the place, if they were not a good fit for me, she would NOT let me get them without explaining WHY a different frame would be the best choice.\n\nBecause I already had my prescription from my eye doctor in North Carolina and just needed to get it filled, I didn't need an appointment.  Because I had just started working at my new job when I moved here, I had to wait until I could comfortably take some time off to go do this.  In September, my friend called Eye Works and asked for the young woman who had impressed HIM so much.  He was told that she was \"out of the office\" but that she would \"be back\" later that day. \n\nWhat a JOKE that was.  THAT particular young woman LEFT this location earlier this year and after dealing with the rest of the staff and having one lady (who I later found out was the DOCTOR and owner of the place) snidely tell me that she did not care if I had a prescription, it was more than six months old and I needed a new exam if I \"expected\" to buy glasses from them.  Yes, you read that correctly. \n\n#1 - my prescription, at the time, was just at FIVE months old.  I had an exam done in the beginning of April of THIS year and moved HERE in the MIDDLE of the month.  I went into this location in September....so, five months.\n\n#2 - IF I EXPECTED TO BUY GLASSES FROM THEM?  No, I expected to be treated with respect being as I was CHOOSING to purchase something from them and had $ to burn on this above what my insurance would have covered.\n\nNeedless to say, I stormed out, my friend was very upset that he had been lied to about the person he wanted to help me still being there, and I found somewhere else to go for my services.  And the upside is that when I brought the business cards to my friend, he was ecstatic because the lady that helped me with my glasses at the new place was the VERY person he was trying to get me to see to begin with.  I found EVERYBODY at Eye Works un-professional,  rude and snide.  Sorry J M that I didn't post before - I may have been able to save you the trouble.", "date": "2012-12-15 00:31:15"}

My first time there, I almost missed the musician I came to see because I didn't realize the stage area was through an unmarked interior door, and was hanging out in the upper bar area wondering when the damn band was going to go on.  I'm not sure if that is a common mistake or not, but it was a little frustrating.  \n\n12th and Porter to me seems to have a split personality.  When you first walk in there's a large bar with a TV and a lot of open space that I'm assuming is for dancing and socializing.  It's decorated in a trendy club kind of fashion, i.e. clean and minimalistic and contemporary, and they show a lot of cool music videos on the TV, but isn't typically the atmosphere I came there for.  To your left as you come in is an interior door that is usually manned by a scruffy yet friendly doorman.  Once you walk through the door, it is like a totally different place.  \n\nThis main room is dark, crowded and loud like you'd expect a rock venue to be.  There's an upper balcony which is really cool, I'm a big fan of interior balconies at venue's, especially ones where you have a good view no matter where you stand.  There's a good sized bar to the right of the stage that serves a good variety of beer and liquor that's a tad bit on the overpriced side, but I think everyone is used to overpriced drinks at clubs by now.  The stage is one of the most put-together ones that I've seen in Nashville.  Their lighting set-up is fantastic, and there are two video screens on either side of the stage that can be utilized by the performer.  I think my favorite show there so far was one of the local band The Protomen.  For those of you unfamiliar, they are an extremely visual band and their performance fit in very well with the venue.\n\nThe location of 12th and Porter is its biggest turn off.  It's randomly located down a side street off of 12th Avenue on the corner of Porter (hence the name).  The area is very run down and is pretty sketchy at night.  Parking is a pain, there is a lot right by the venue, but it's small and full of huge pot holes and generally hard to maneuver through.  The last time I went there a random homeless person was directing cars where to park down a slightly scary side street.  I thought it was pretty hilarious, but some people might not find that to be as funny as I.  He seemed to know what he was doing, as the car was still there when we left, scratch and break in free.\n\nI wish more touring bands came here as I'd pick 12th and Porter over Exit/In any day.  Their calendar can be hit or miss (check it out on their Myspace page) with a lot of their acts being unknowns.  They do have writer's nights which are cool, but I still think the End is your best bet for the best shows by bands you've never heard of.", "date": "2008-12-27 19:07:12"}

Their Connor the Crawfish (small or large sized) is my dogs' favorite and I have to bring one home every time I stop by.\n\nThe staff is always helpful, and if they don't have something you're looking for in the Quarter location, they can check over at Riverwalk to see if there's something there they can put on hold for you.\n\nGreat overall experience and I'm always excited to stop there in when I'm in town!", "date": "2021-01-01 18:56:10"}

Well, thanks to Wholesale Auto I'm scared every time I buckle him in his carseat. The light for the transmission came on the day after I bought it (which means the code had been cleared). So, i took it back down there and after sitting in the waiting room for half an hour a mechanic came back and told me \"Well we cleared the code so we'll see if it comes back on.\" I was blown away. They treated me like I was so stupid that I would think that turning the light off would fix the problem. I decided to take matters into my own hands and took the car in to get a transmission flush...$180 dollars later the light was still on and the shop told me the fluid was BLACK. I felt hopeless but I was so busy HAVING A BABY that I didn't get back to the dealership. They called me 6 months later and I missed the call so I called them back not even 10 minutes later and told them that I needed to talk to them and no response. Finally, I messaged them on Facebook and they called me and had me come down. They looked at it and handed me a quote to get my transmission replaced. I said that I wasn't going to pay it so they told me they could cover the cost of labor and that was it. Like if you think Wholesale Auto should replace the faulty transmission they sold to a pregnant woman. Feel free to share so no one you love gets screwed like I did\nUPDATE: They are replacing my transmission with no cost to me !!! The owner called me this morning and told me he's taking care of the problem and he talked to a friend of mine who helped him understand?!

The bisque was creamy and savory, and just thick enough so that it would be fantastic as a dip for fresh bread from Corropolese or People's.  I only had toasted Butter Bread courtesy of Sara Lee but it was still delicious.  Seriously, try it.  Heat the soup for a few min while you toast a roll and then enjoy!  It's more savory, healthier, and more flavorful than EVOO or Irish butter.  I didn't actually intend on finishing the entire bowl but it was that good.  The lump crabmeat salad was  creamy and full of actual pieces of crab, not \"krab\" aka surimi.  I can imagine that it would be fantastic on a toasted, buttered roll.  Alas, father dearest tried a bite and ate the entire container before I even got a second taste.  Next time, I'll remember to get more (and hide some for myself in the fridge).  Service was very friendly and helpful.  I'll have to stop in for lunch since their entrees (and just about everything else) are very nicely priced (less than $10 for fish, starch, and veggie).  And the leftover late-lunch melt?  Only ate about half due to the unintended bisque overindulgence. It just paled in comparison to the soup.", "date": "2012-04-21 03:50:29"}

Overall it was splendiferous.  Hattie B's fried chicken is my spirit animal. I'm certain it came straight out of Yahweh's kitchen.  \n\nFor sides I got fries and pimento mac and cheese.  The mac attack was tremendous.  The fries were well seasoned.\n\nWe sat facing the line of people. I could see their eyes fill with terror as they watched me eat like a pig at a trough. I didn't care. I go into a zone when eating great food and it gets wild. \n\nI'm just going to say that if you don't like this place then I hate you.  Simple as that.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me I'm going to hop in the car and drive back to Nashville.  My bride-to-be is waiting for me.", "date": "2015-05-26 19:24:48"}

The food and atmosphere are very good to excellent. Unfortunately, our service left much to be desired. \n\nSetting: We were a group of 8 adults with some young children who didn't require anything except food from the menu. Our beverage order was about average - half coffees, the rest water (which is self serve from filled containers on the table) with a couple other beverages (fresh pressed juice, etc.) \n\nAtmosphere: Beautiful setting that is modern and eclectic. Everything was clean. \n\nService: We has a group reservation at 10:30 on a Saturday morning. We weren't seated til almost 11:15 due to another party being at the table we were supposed to have. I understand it isn't always possible to honor your reservation times, but 45 minutes late is a bit much. Finally, we scouted out the area and proposed a solution to the host, which was quickly accommodated. Our waitress was not particularly friendly with her greeting nor well equipped to offer suggestions from the menu. When our food was brought to the table, the runner asked whose dish he had, but had put multiple side dishes together, which no one ordered. His response wasn't to split them up and see who had them, rather \"Well I'll sit them in the middle of the table and you all can figure it out ourselves,\" which was not in a very friendly tone. I know working Saturday morning brunch isn't the best, but showing a little enthusiasm and hospitality to your patrons goes a long way for us. As soon as we had paid our bill, our waitress was refilling the flatware buckets and then sat them in front of us (not placed back to the middle of the table), which felt like a not-so-subtle hint for us to leave. \n\nFood: Very good. Portions are appropriate - not too small, not too large. Well seasoned and fresh ingredients that complemented each other well. Good variety of menu options without being overwhelming. \n\nOverall: 3/5", "date": "2018-02-10 17:45:04"}

The food wasn't horrible for what it was. The kids loved it.  It reminded us of Circus Circus in Las Vegas (which is where we're from). There was a carousel, bumper cars, go carts, video games, etc.... Basically, a kid's dream. The only downside was that everything was pretty run down.  There were a bunch of games that were out of order.  There were some sections that were closed and the entire place was pretty filthy. I think it they put a little more care into the place and maintained all their machines, that they'd probably do much better and get more business. Overall, it works for me and the kids. Just remember to bring some hand sanitizer and you'll be ok.", "date": "2011-07-28 04:36:29"}

Howard, but I eventually got fed up with its $50-plus per month fee, and it changed management that was not as good, as well. So, I needed a new gym. This basic chain offers $10 mo for everything I need, which is free weights, some machines and the occasional cardio. I do not need, or want to pay for, classes, boxing, cycling, tanning and a fancy locker-room. This place has anything a true fitness fiend really needs.\nI like the green and purple decor. It's always clean, and the music soundtrack is fine. If you need a lot of bells and whistles, look elsewhere. I usually go in late afternoons, and it's never too busy. Now, if you go on Monday nights, you might face a little crowd since that's when all the once-a-week workout people seem to show up to try to work off their weekends. The location, in a sketchy strip-mall with few other tenants, leaves a little to be desired, but that's not too important. I don't bother with the Lime card for $20 mo, which gets you into other locations. Don't need it, though they are always trying to push it.\nMy only complaint is it sometimes takes them weeks, if not months, to repair broken equipment. That should be done a lot faster.", "date": "2014-01-21 16:25:05"}

However, we were able to find parking in the parking garage just down the street (4 min walk away). Plus it helped later for walking off the food we would soon enjoy. \n\nWe started with the 'Glory Curds' and Shrimp. The curds were amazing. Crunchy and crispy on the outside, gooey and cheesy goodness on the inside. Large curds, small curds, all delicious. The shrimp was also very flavorful. Crispy and went really well with the spicy dipping sauce they came with (the curds also went well with the spicy shrimp sauce just FYI). \n\nFor dinner we enjoyed a couple of Hub burgers and my wife got the NY strip. The burgers and steak were perfectly cooked to our liking. Nothing over done and everything juicy. The burgers had pastrami, Swiss and coleslaw. All the flavors paired very well together. Criticism about the burger: the coleslaw was a bit too juicy and made the bottom bun way too soggy. Almost falling apart. I really did enjoy the slaw but maybe less juices? Something to combat the soggy bun would help. Otherwise it was delicious. The tater tots and fries were very good too. Pretty big portions all around!\n\nWe ended the meal with their ice cream. I went with a scoop of blackberry and a scoop of the lavender & honey. Both were refreshing and creamy. The blackberry could have used a bit more blackberry flavor in my opinion. The lavender and honey was unique and worth a try! My wife went with the oatmeal cookie batter (I believe) and that was very very tasty. \n\nThe staff were very friendly and considerate. Everything was clean and tidy and the dining area was well decorated.

Pretty cool. \n\nMead is a honey-wine and tends to taste like a mix of beer, wine, and cider all in one. The meads at Black Rabbit are cider-style and are made with honey sourced from the Sierra Nevadas. They're currently serving four meads: Church of Roger, Hawaiian Ember, Song of Rasputin, and 3 Headed Rabbit. A tasting of four (any combo) is $10 and is well worth it. So far my favorites are the Church of Roger and the Hawaiian Ember; I typically get two of each of these in my tasting because I enjoy them that much. And while it would make more sense for me to order a glass of my favorite, I still prefer the opportunity to enjoy several different flavors in smaller tasting sizes.

Get up to the counter for someone to look over all the paperwork I brought, give me a vision test and to give me a number. I took the number and sat down and waited for about an hour to an hour and a half. The number tells you how many other people are waiting in the same category.

After moving to the Indianapolis area, I heard my friends absolutely rave about Bakersfield on Mass Ave. \"The tacos are so good! And they have the best margaritas!\" I thought, okay.. well, if it's so good I may as well try it. My first experience was with my boyfriend. The atmosphere was crowded, noisy and I could barely hear him talk. While sitting at the bar stool- Keg tables, I kept getting ran into by waitresses and other customers. Not a very comfortable way to try and enjoy your lunch. We ordered an appetizer of the guacamole, chips and queso. The guac is incredible. absolutely perfect- the queso on the other hand tastes like they emptied a freezer burnt bag of shredded cheese into a pan in melted it. When the tacos came out, my boyfriend exclaimed, \"these are tiny!\" lol. good thing we ordered the appetizer. Not only were the tacos tiny, but also were incredibly lacking in flavor. Disappointing. The staff treated us as though they were trying to move us out quickly and had no time for us. The other trip I would like to elaborate on was my last visit. My best friend arrived just a few minutes before I did, was first in line and was ignored 4 times while they seated her. There was no, \"miss, would you mind waiting for a seat, because these people have the whole party here.\" No. she was straight up ignored. I got there, Kaylee got a beer and I opted to try one of the \"fantastic\" margaritas. My margarita was definitely anything but fantastic. I could make a better margarita out of a bottle mix in my blender at home for cheaper. The waitress brought us out our guac and queso (kaylee wanted the queso. gross!) and the guac was of course, amazing. Then we waited..and waited..and waited some more. Finally, a whopping 43 minutes later the waitress came back to check on us and took our order. I'm usually a lenient and patient person, but the kicker is THEY WEREN'T BUSY! We ordered the food, this time better than the last.. and then we found ourselves waiting another 40 minutes for our checks after we had finished. I appreciate the \"fun\" atmosphere they're trying to develop here.. 83 minutes of waiting during dinner just isn't fun. I am disappointed and don't really recommend it.

(come to find out he use to sell cars!)  we had two vendors measure the room, both came up with 270 total square feet.

Apparently my salesperson John C is not aware of something called the internet. I knew the price range I should be able to lease the vehicle for by using Edmunds and KBB to understand what a fair price would be for the car. John C was proposing I pay list for the car, when I already knew the average price paid was 1500 under MSRP. He didn't seem to understand that by discounting the car 1500 it would lower my down payment or monthly lease cost. How a car sales person could not understand that concept was beyond belief. After 2 days of this nonsense I called and asked to speak with his sales manager directly. The sales manager was unavailable, so I had to leave him voice mail. I never received a return call from the sales manager, however I did get a call from John C on his day off. So obviously the sales manager didn't want to deal with me directly.  After getting jerked around for 3 days I went to Piazza Honda of Reading, where I was able to get a fair price within minutes. When I let Roberts Honda and John C know I was looking elsewhere, they were now able to now get a sales manager Greg on the phone, and he got me the price I was looking for. Unfortunately it took them 3 days to get there, not to mention the aggravation of dealing with an incompetent sales rep. I don't do business that way, and when I told John C I would be purchasing from the other dealer, he sent me 10 text messages questioning my decision. Really hard to believe this guy can make a living selling cars. Since I did purchase my Honda from another dealership, I can't comment on Roberts service department, however their sales rep may have been the worst I have ever come across.", "date": "2017-11-19 17:50:04"}

It sadly appears that there was a change of ownership since my last visit. Maybe it was a staff change. All I know is the people that I remember are no longer there. I hope they are doing well.\n\nThe service was still good. The young lady at the counter was very nice and I didn't have to wait too long for my takeout order. There was only one other person picking up a takeout order in the restaurant at around 5:30 on a Saturday. \n\nI ordered the sweet & sour shrimp for my mother and the pho with veggies for myself. I've had their pho before, but it was different this time. Before I had the brisket, meatball, and chicken. I remember it being a light colored broth that was very tasty. This time it was a dark brown color. The flavor of this one had more of a cinnamon taste to it. It was also saltier than what I've had before at this restaurant. The rest of the flavors were there, but I didn't have the same comforting feeling that I usually get with pho. There was a generous portion of veggies and I liked the inclusion of scallions, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and those little baby corn things. I was a little disappointed that the Thai basil leaves weren't as fresh as what I had recently at another restaurant in the area.  Everything else was very fresh. Mom thought the sweet & sour shrimp was good, but not quite as good as it was before. I don't know what happened. I can say that it's still very affordable. That hasn't changed. I'll still go back every now & then to try other menu items. They may have different specialties so I just have to find out what it is that they do best. I'll update my review if anything else changes. As of now, it's A-OK.", "date": "2019-10-05 23:23:08"}

Located on Third  Street South, Bento serves cooked foods and sushi in a fast casual setting.  You order your food with the cashier, get a number, grab your seat, and a server brings your food right to your table.  You can place an order to-go if you're on the move.  You can also call ahead and place an order for pickup.\n\nI've been eating Bento since my college days in UF.  It's nice to see them taking over Florida and never losing their quality taste or quick service.\n\nI ordered my usual build-your-own poke bowl.  They have 3 sizes: mini, regular, and large.  The regular has 2 proteins + 1 base (white rice, brown rice, or greens) + 4 mix-ins + 2 toppings.  For $11, you get a good sized portion of ingredients made to your specific liking.\n\nI also ordered a boba milk tea, which is just average in my opinion.  It is now one of the few places in DTSP where you can order boba tea quickly to-go.\n\nThere is indoor and outdoor seating.  Although it was just a soft open, the servers were quick to clean vacated tables so new customers could sit right away.  I imagine that during peak hours, it will get crowded quickly.\n\nIf you are craving some good pan-Asian cuisine, definitely check out Bento Cafe.", "date": "2018-10-01 17:41:14"}

Infact I wasn't sure if they were even suppose to be croutons or if they were going for the chewy stale pretzel slices angle. The salad was also served on a plate so small it made it extremely difficult to eat without making a huge mess.

But I found the lighting has even become worse with the new owners and I can hardly see my car to see if I have cleaned it.

But since the new owners have taken over there has been no wax at this place. But they continue to list is as a services and charge you for it even though they know they don't have it. I have gone to them to complain many times. The owner comes to look at my car and claims it is working. I show him that it should bead off my windows and he sits there dumbfounded. He goes back to his utility room to check his wax and comes back to claim it is fully loaded. But he is completely lying. I  assumed that maybe it was just a one time bad occurrence but I had returned and used different stalls and again the same thing. Always speaking to the owner and he love to lie and claim it works. I was so frustrated I drove across the street to the shell where their hand wand wax works perfectly. Spent another two minutes there to properly wax my car. \n\nThen the other day I was rushing into town and wanted to wash my car quickly with their brushless automatic system, and on a car that is not too dirty this system has always worked perfectly. However my first time using it under the new ownership has proved to me that they have also taken the wax out of the automatic system as well.

We took my out of town friend visiting from PA here as the basque dining experience is so unique to this area. We first sat at the bar to order a picon. The bartender (I forget his name but he had been there for 30 some years) was awesome. He made an terrific picon and provided a suggestion how how to drink it which was much appreciated as those buggers are strong! He also shared a good deal of knowledge about the basque community here and its history. \n\nOnce we were ready to move from the bar, we took seats at one of the long family style tables. I let my friend know that he needed to prepare his stomach (I had been to another basque restaurant in town and know how much food you get) but what soon came even I was surprised by! \n\nYou start with the softest yummiest bread and butter (I could literally eat the basket myself). You're served a large carafe of table wine and also out comes the soup. Split pea soup was the soup the night we went and it was enjoyed by all. Then comes a chicken dish which reminded me of chicken cacciatore. Wait, not done yet... then out comes salad... and a bean dish... THEN all three of us ordered the lamb as our entree and out comes a massive pile of perfectly cooked lamb chops. It was awesome. Somehow we managed to clean up. \n\nGreat place to come and enjoy fantastic home style food. The quality and quantity you get for the price is unbelievable. If you come with a small group like we did, be prepare to sit with strangers but don't be shy. It's a great place to meet new people. We had a blast.", "date": "2019-06-20 03:30:23"}

I chalked it up to a weird dairy reaction, but didn't care about going back. Today, though, the office was excited about the spring-like weather and wanted to walk somewhere closeby. Cue Chuy's.\n\nCue meh-ness.\n\nChuy's offered a special \"rapido\" lunch menu where you could get one of about 8 entrees (with beans and rice) along with a drink and dessert for $9.99. The rapido menu also promised that they'd bring your food out within 15 minutes within certain hours. Before I could carefully look at the rapido menu, the server took our drink orders. I uncharacteristically ordered a Sierra Mist with no ice, since it was going to be included in the menu deal.\n\nAll of that sounded good, except once I actually got to read the menu, I didn't see a vegetarian option. I sighed and ordered chiles rellenos from the regular menu, and the menu said it came with black beans and white rice. I asked to substitute Mexican rice instead of white and was told this would be fine.\n\nDespite not being on the rapido menu, my entree came out at the same time as the others. Unfortunately, my soda had ice in it and my rice was white. I didn't want to make a fuss, so I just started eating. My pepper had some veggies in it - spinach, maybe some squash or zuchini - and was topped with red sauce and cheese, but it was all very bland. There was no spice, and I couldn't tell the veggies apart. Likewise, my rice had no taste, and the black beans weren't very good.\n\nIt came time to order dessert, and we had our choice of sheet cake or sopapilla. I chose sopapilla, though I haven't eaten it yet as I had it immediately boxed to go.\n\nThere was a bit of an issue with the bills. About 8 of us dined, but Chuy's insisted on putting us all on one check. Some paid with cash, but quite a few of us had to use cards. That's all fine, but our server ended up splitting the checks evenly. For many people, this was ok - a lot of folks had the $9.99 special. However, some people ordered extra sour cream and guac (for an extra cost), and my entree was supposed to be $1 less than the others. Again, we shrugged and paid it, but we weren't happy.\n\nI likely won't be back again.", "date": "2011-02-14 23:55:52"}

We had a group of six and they actually had a party of six cancel which worked out perfectly.  We got sat right away and our drinks came out quickly.  For it being lunchtime however, the service was extremely slow.  Having a 13 month old with us, we were expecting the food to come out much quicker especially during lunch.  The baby got his food first and he actually basically finished his meal before we even got our soups and salads.  By the time our meals came out, he was ready to go.  \n\nThe food is sub-par for the price you are paying.  3 of the 4 adults got the business lunch special (2 courses for $21).  I started with the Signature Salad which was really good.  They don't allow you to stray from the set menu.  We asked if we could get the special they were running for the festival (strawberry salad), but they do not do that.  For the price you are paying, I didn't see what the big deal was.   Not like we were asking for a piece of steak as a substitute.  Salad for a salad.  Star lost for not being accomodating.  Husband ordered the She-Crab bisque and it was one dimensional.  He liked it but all I tasted was cream.  They really skimped on the crab meat.  Lack of quality will be a common theme in this review.  My sister got the Scallops and she actually left hungry.  The scallops were gritty and the dish itself was bland.  They do a great job plating though.  I ordered the petit filet and ordered it Med. rare.  It came out rare.  I ate it anyway since I didn't want to wait any longer for our food.  The server actually did not ask us to cut into our filets to make sure it was cooked properly.  My dish came out messy.  I barely had any onions on my dish while my brother-in-law had a pile of it on his filet.  The meat is not of high quality at all and was just grisly.  I absolutely love the vibrant colors of brussel sprouts and my expectations were disappointed when it came out and looked like limp sauteed bacon and cabbage.  For how long it took to come out, it looked like they literally threw my meat on the grill and took it off right away and threw the bacon and brussel sprouts into a sautee pan and threw it on the plate (5 minutes total of cook time is what I give it).\n\nThumbs up to the bartender.  We thoroughly enjoyed our Right not Left.  Perfect balance of bitter, sweet, and sour.  The muddled cucumbers and strawberries made the drink so refreshing and how can you go wrong with Patron.  With tip, our lunch for a table of 4 adults and 2 kids came to $200.  On the hefty side but we never have a problem paying this much when we actually get quality food.  Left walking around the festival feeling we would have enjoyed the food at the festival more and paying only a 1/4 of the price.  Save your money until the restaurant actually focuses on the quality.  Tricking people into thinking you are offering quality by charging quality prices is just straight up mean and disappointing.", "date": "2014-05-06 16:51:42"}

The men appreciated that there was a TV screen between scoring screens that was turned to a sports channel.\n\nThere was enough of us that we ordered quite a few of the items offered.  The food consists of small appetizer portions.

I had the sweet potato taquitos, roasted corn salad, mole duck confit, and tres leches. I will admit, the sweet potato taquitos were bomb and honestly tasted like cheese instead because of how sweet and creamy they were; however the rest of the food items made me sad and I don't like being sad after eating dinner.\n\nThe roasted corn salad had a dressing that tasted like watery ketchup with maybe a dozen pieces of actual roasted corn. The mole duck confit barely had any mole on it, and whatever spoonful of mole was on there it tasted burnt and bitter. The duck itself was dry. The tres leches cake was legitimately corn bread. It tasted like good corn bread, but not tres leches cake. There was no cream for it to soak in, and it came with some weird vanilla bean sorbet that tasted kind of sour.\n\nOur food also took way too long to come out, especially the dessert. It came out a good twenty minutes after we had finished our meal which is odd because room temperature corn bread and ice cream don't take time to prep.\n\nSorry ya'll, but I'm not impressed.

I did experience a minor issue that management fixed (hence the 4 stars in lieu of 3). The bathroom was not cleaned to the best ability and the guest next to my room was coughing so loudly I could not imagine getting a decent nights rest. Not only did they move me to a new room down the hall, but they also gifted me complimentary Hilton Honors points. The beds are super comfortable and there's plenty of complimentary parking. The breakfast was also good and equipped with standard Hilton property offerings. The only other downside is the technical issue with the TV.

Moving from Longmont, CO to The Dalles, OR.  First, I was told one week before my container drop off date that PODS does not service the area I was moving to because it is 50 miles away from their main service yard in Portland, OR-even though I was initially told this was not the case!  I tried to find a moving company that could help in that short amount of time but it was not an option.  Second, I called last Saturday to ok the payment for the container to be shipped ($1869.00). Their customer service assured me delivery in Portland on the 23rd.  Since PODS doesn't service the area I am moving to I called movers who requested the weight of my container in order to quote a price.  I called PODS back and found that they could take my container weight for $40 the day after it arrives.  During this conversation I found out that \"there was an error in shipping\" and that my container was not yet marked to be shipped and would now have to be shipped guaranteed to arrive on the 25th-glad I called otherwise the container would have likely sat there.  Even though there was an error with shipping there was no error in billing me $1869 for the container shipment.  Third, while on the phone with customer service the woman decided to \"do me favor\" and see if they could drop the container any closer to my desired location.\n She found a yard in Clackamas, OR that is about 10 miles closer to me in The Dalles and asked if I wanted it dropped there instead.  I agreed only if it would not incur an additional charge.  She verbally confirmed that it would not and made the change.  This morning I wake to find an additional\ncharge if $207.74 to my card on file and they still have not shipped the container!!!!   Go with anybody else that you can for your move people.\n\nAll said and done, PODS looked cheaper on the front end but for where Im at now I would have saved money, time and physical energy going with Allied or another moving company.", "date": "2018-01-17 12:34:47"}

Its attempt to keep the charm from its golden days comes across as stubbornly stuck in the past. Everything is dripping in burgundy except its \"grandma's china\" place settings. I don't mind that type of old world charm but it's not being portrayed correctly. It's a very odd mix of things that do not say fine dining. The old saying is \"you can put lipstick on a pig, but that doesn't make it a beauty queen\" well, Kemoll's can have a waiter serve cheesy bread in a tuxedo, but it doesn't make it fine dining.\n\nThe portions of food are large but the quality is poor. The prices are way too high for what they are serving. Mussels came to the table uncleaned and with broken shells mixed into the seafood risotto; the risotto itself was over cooked. When we brought up the issue of the mussels we got a brush off from the girl that picked up the plate and a \"oh, sorry\" from our waiter. Nothing else was said.  The manicotti was nothing spectacular at all. If you put it next to a dish from Olive Garden, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I make all of my own pasta at home and may have high expectations for true Italian dishes but it's unfortunate to pay so much money for lackluster dishes. However, the fried artichoke appetizer was unique and delicious but still not fine dining.\n\nOur waiter, Billy's, positive and friendly attitude made up for the piss poor \"I could care less about this stupid job\" attitude the table clearring blonde woman was sporting. I looked at the dessert menu but passed; nothing really jumped out at me. After Billy overheard it was my birthday, he slipped a piece of chocolate cake with a candle in a to-go bag saying \"you have to have cake on your birthday!\". He was a very sweet and knowledgeable man.\n\nOverall, Kemoll's is stuck in the past of a fine dining restaurant that they no longer are.  If they update and revamp some decor, lower the portions, and greatly increase their food quality, they can rereach that fine dining standard again. For now, I won't be back and would not recommend.", "date": "2015-10-13 03:50:33"}

Where do I start? From beginning to end, this was a fantastic experience. Everything about this place was absolutely fantastic. I really liked the art on the walls! I wish they had this place in Flagstaff. They would be the best Mexican style cuisine restaurant in the entire city. There wouldn't be a single empty seat. After a very disappointing Thai food experience the night before, we wanted some really good food. The day had been great so far, and seeing how we were leaving that night we wanted to end on a great note. We couldn't decide what to eat then we remembered that Flagstaff doesn't really have any good Mexican food. BOOM! And the hunt was on. We walked so far considering that Flagstaff is only a fraction the size of Tucson hahaha. But not without enjoying the amazing stores, creative street art, and murals around 4th Ave. We finally asked someone where we could get some great Mexican food. She went to the back and asked a coworker who was Mexican. She recommended LA Indita. Turns out it wasn't that far at all. She said, \"the service is a little slow but the food is amazing.\" In my experience those are the places with the best food! I would rather wait a few extra minutes and have amazing food. In this case, the service was prompt, friendly, attentive but not invasive. Absolutely perfect. The moment we walked in the cutest little girl came to our table and pursued to take our drink orders.  It was the cutest touch to a business I had ever seen. From there we ordered our food. I have eaten at so many Mexican restaurants that I am not easily impressed by them. First thing that stood out to me was, the chips and salsa that was served. I have never been to a Mexican Restaurant where they serve the chips warm. I'm pretty sure they make their own chips. They are very consistant in size and texture. The salsa they serve them with is so good. Not that stuff out of a container. So far I'm already loving this place. Me and my friend order the Thursday special, and the lady ordered the bean and rice burrito. Okay, I have had so many burritos in my life I don't even think of judging one. A burrito is a burrito, but I don't know what they put in their beans that make them so darn good, but Daaamn they are good. And the tortilla has actual flavor. Not just a hot tortilla. The lady was just saying over and over how amazing it was. I'm pretty sure she said it was the best burrito she has ever had... twice hahaha.  Me and my friends meal was just as good! The beans, the rice, the enchilada, but that green sauce tho! That sauce was something else. I would slap the Pope for some of that sauce right now. LOL!! Meanwhile that little girl is greeting all new tables that walk in and is just the most precious thing. She didn't even have a note pad. She was doing it all on memory. Just the fact that they are instilling her with a sense of work ethic was awesome to see. You don't get this kind of food and experience at a corporate, dresscode enforced, there way is the only way, 8 minute ticket times kind of restaurant.   It isn't some cookie cutter, chain quality food. This is from scratch, passion in every bite quality type of food. Honestly, if I would have had to wait I still would have given them 5. The food quality and the service style is just amazing. I think they ruined other Mexican food for me haha. Everyone else will be compared to LA Indita.

I found this hotel a good fit for me for that night.  I wanted to tour the city and I was a good walking distance away from the city.  beds were clean and clear when I arrived, and even when that wasn't taken into precaution, I was able to see the sun set and rise that night and next morning.  I could even see the Ride the Ducks operation boat enter the Delaware River from nearby.\n\nIt's a bit hard to find at first, but when you do try to find it, it's fairly easy to spot.  It's quite a distance from the nearest Interstate exit that links to this major Philadelphia route(I-95) but when you see the bridge nearby that goes over the Delaware River that is also I-95 that goes into NJ and you see Campbell Field from your room, it's quite impressive to look at.\n\nThe only problem was I had a top-level of the hotel- room(nosebleed section)-but, if you compared that to my booking options saying that my room had to have the slightly more costly River-View, I got what I paid for.  I didn't even expect that they would have a room for me, just a month before my trip-then when I get there having to use this particular room-after forgetting to mention my preferences over room placement?\n\nIf you're hoping to use their WiFi, make sure to pick up a single sheet for their secure wireless code that you'll need to login to their network-from their front desk.  I don't know much, but I think it's a one-day one night, single use code.\n\nThe staff was kind, gentle and nice.  Their complimentary breakfast was good, well stocked, and just overly great.  I had no other trouble with the A/C, but be weary that the parking is not free at this hotel.  Either way, being able to walk to all the major attractions in the historic district, was definitely a plus. \n\nThe bad thing is, some of the major attractions that I was hoping to see nearby did not include the Stadiums of Philadelphia-Citizens Bank Ballpark, Wachovia Arena, Wachovia Center, Lincoln Financial Field, the former site of Veterans field, etc.(I did spot them later on my trip back on I-95, but that's beyond the point.\n\nI had one problem with Philadelphia itself, but it's nothing that my hotel could have helped me find or organize-the ticket purchase place and boarding place(two different places) for the Ride the Ducks tour that I had so wanted to take that year was hard to organize and I didn't even ride it due to this issue.", "date": "2011-03-08 22:53:09"}

I started coming to Diamond Nails at the beginning of this summer and had nothing but awesome experiences! The staff were always friendly, they had a great color selection, and I always felt like the finished product looked great. Because of my good experiences, I decided to make reservations for a bridal party to all come together to get their nails done at the end of August (I am the maid of honor in the wedding). I called two weeks in advanced and made the appointments--five manicures and five pedicures beginning at 4:30 on a Friday afternoon. I made sure they knew that we were a bridal party and they said it would be no problem.\n\nWell, it was a huge problem.\n\nWe showed up Friday for our appointments to find that the salon only had four technicians (not a big problem, though our confirmation said we'd have 5). However, all four techs were either at the beginning or in the middle of doing someone's nails. I get that Friday afternoon is a busy time of day for salons, but THAT'S WHY I MADE APPOINTMENTS! One of the technicians got me seating at a pedicure station where I sat for FORTY MINUTES before they actually began my pedicure. AND I WAS THE FIRST ONE THEY STARTED! Some of my fellow bridesmaids waited well over an hour for their service to begin and spent the bulk to that time with their feet soaking in cold water. It was incredibly frustrating. Instead of having a fun, relaxing afternoon like we'd planned, it became really stressful as we watched the minutes tick by knowing that we had somewhere to be at 7:30 and we were not going to done. \n\nI raised the point that we had reservations and needed to leave by no later than 6:45. The technicians assured us that they could finish all of our pedicures and manicures, which was a total lie. In the end, three of us didn't get our manicures because there was no time. One of us who did get her manicure didn't finish until 7:10. In the end, the work they did was sloppy because they were rushing to try and not lose our business, which really wouldn't have been a problem had they started when our appointment was originally scheduled instead of 40-60 minutes later.\n\nI know this is long and it's the first negative review this place has received. If you go by yourself and have unlimited time, this place is great. HOWEVER, if you make a reservation, do not be surprised if you show up and they don't honor it, especially if it's at a busy time of day. I know that, despite my good experiences in the past, I definitely won't be back. They acted so unprofessionally. If you take appointments as a business, you better make sure you can honor them, especially if you take them for a large group. Clearly, Diamond Nails does not understand that basic tenet of the salon business, so I won't be back and neither will any of my friends.", "date": "2015-08-29 16:56:32"}

I'm not sure if it was because of the size of the table, the filth surrounding us or the fact that we felt even more away from home and alone standing in that a room but when she asked \"is this ok\" we all 3 very sadly replied no.\nAnother 10 minutes went by and we stood there continuing to hear servers complain... an exact quote from a server after she asked the male host if there were anymore reservations for the night and he said no was \"Thank Fucking God\".\nWe then were seated and by the saving grace of GOD the only server and person in that entire restaurant that we had seen for the past 45 minutes with a smile and that looked like she knew what she was doing approached our table.  We were quickly relieved.  \nHer name was LIV and she was a doll.  She turned our entire experience around and allowed us to feel as close to home with friendly conversation and passionate concern that we were having a wonderful Christmas dinner, we could not thank her enough.\nMy only hope in writing this review is not to nag on those who were clearly upset about working on Christmas (don't worry I was upset I had to work too) but my wish in this post is that those people who were so miserable can learn from this and take after Liv's positive attitude and realize that their behavior can make or break someones experience and that they aren't the only ones making a sacrifice during the holidays.", "date": "2016-12-27 03:32:13"}

I went to pick up a three item combo for my family with the same expectation of great seafood at a reasonable price, but when I returned home, I noticed something was wrong with the fish. They smelled like fecal matter and ammonia. Those smells are normally associated with unclean and rotten fish. I grew up on the bayou, so I know this smell. Someone on the team cooked and served rotten fish.\n\nI'd never experienced that from this place before, and I thought to alert the store immediately of the problem, so no one could get sick from Ciguatera or Scombroid, because when I first purchased food there based on a friend sharing their meal, one of the employees prided themselves on having a great establishment and hoping to be able to keep up with the new customer demand. I didn't want to see their business go down, let alone have anyone get sick, especially with Covid-19 going on, so I tried called the store.\n\nUnfortunately, each time I called, I was sent to voicemail, and as I began to leave a message, the phone was hung up. I tried three (3) times calling the number ending in 1206, until I went back to the website and tried calling the number ending in 1207. When I tried the secondary number, I encountered the same problem.\n\nI'm not sure if it was the staff from the 10:30am to 8pm shift that worked today, but I feel really sorry to have to write this review. I just don't want anyone to get poisoned, and sadly, answering the phone just once would've helped with this situation, instead of making it this public. I hope the staff that did not cause this dilemma understand. No one deserves to be sent to the ER, because someone was completely irresponsible or just didn't care enough for their customers.\n\nI'm providing a link to Poison Control relating to food poisoning from fish. Hopefully, this will help some who received food from there between those hours. I'm not sure what happened, but I hope it can be resolved and no customers get hurt from the employees ignoring my phone calls.\n\nhttps://www.poison.org/articles/2009-jun/what-you-cant-smell-can-hurt", "date": "2020-05-02 00:15:53"}

They all taste the same to me. So take my review with that in mind.\n\nI really didn't know what to expect upon coming here except exceptional tasting fish, as majority of these reviews say. It's a cute little cabin-looking place, which makes it feel less like a restaurant. I'm not sure why, but I was expecting more on their menu than what was there. But hey, stick to what you're good at: smoked fish. The dinner platter fish choices are salmon, mackerel, mahi-mahi, and mullet. Like I said, I don't know anything about fish, so it's not like I can tell you the difference among these. So, I let my dinner partner choose the salmon for us.\n\nThe platter is big enough for two to share. It comes with coleslaw, potato salad, onion, tomato, and two sauces. It's an additional $2 if you want an extra plate when sharing. (Seems a bit pricey for a plate, silverware, onion, tomato, and 2 small sauces.) The fish itself was NOT hot, as I expected like other restaurants, but I let it go. The taste itself was pretty good. You can really taste the smoked-ness of it. The waitress didn't really explain what the sauces were, just that they were both varieties of horse radish, one spicy and the other not. I liked the not spicy one. I think I read on some reviews that the German potato salad was supposed to be warm? Ours wasn't, but still good enough, I suppose. \n\nNOT convenient is that they take cash only! For a business that's been around for 50+ years, I couldn't think of a reason they wouldn't take card. It's small, yes, but seems popular enough among locals and tourists. \n\nSo, really, I'm glad I finally got to taste the fish the town's been talking about, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way again to eat there.", "date": "2013-03-04 21:41:48"}

Thus, I've never been here for a normal meal and ordered a normal item off the menu like a normal person. But I've been to the buffet many times, since the place is right across the street (or *almost* just across the street) from Lettuce Lake Park, a lovely place to wander and gawp at the alligators and weird birds for the princely sum of $2.\n\nUtterly full disclosure: If I have any tiny trace of blood from the Indian subcontinent, it's been so diluted and diffused by generation upon generation of angry people who make angry-looking buildings that it probably now couldn't fill a grasshopper's coffee mug, and I'm pretty sure that I've never been within three thousand miles of Delhi. So I have no claim to judge what constitutes authentic Indian food of any stripe, and anyone who does should feel free to snort contemptuously and consign this review to whatever part of their brain they use to store voicemails about extending their car warranty or the phone books that regularly land in their yards and absorb rain and reclaimed water until they're a soupy mess.\n\nBut, even given the above caveats, this very well might be the best Indian restaurant I've ever visited. I've had a long and checkered career of visiting Indian restaurants, from the dismal downtown buffet where you eat too much chicken tikka for no discernible reason (it does not spark joy or create satisfaction, but still you keep eating it) and enter a state of such profound drowsiness that you immediately understand that you will never get anything important done for the rest of the day, to the smalltown restaurant putting on airs with white tablecloths and silver where the most complex item on the menu is saag paneer, to the grotesque and misbegotten Midwestern late-Fifties steadily-collapsing concrete-and-sheet-metal monstrosity where beef vindaloo (???) is on the menu and the servers mispronounce the names of dishes with the insouciant confidence of the utterly damned. So, whatever mitigating factors might be in place, I stand by my pronouncement.\n\nThe buffet, and the menu in general (which, again, I haven't sampled at length, but have browsed) seem to make reluctant concessions to American taste, offering some of the usual suspects (butter chicken, tikka masala, whatever vindaloo), but seem to be mostly interested in going beyond that. The weekend buffet reliably has goat curry, which is wonderful (and spicy!) and not something that is regularly included in the genre, and the chili chicken (which is usually interpreted as some soupy, sticky variant on Chinese food, as per its origins) is a sort of dry, fried, spice-encrusted dish, gloriously addictive. And many dishes whose names are unfamiliar to me--a sort of rice pudding, but not the kheer that is easily found at every five-and-dime buffet across the nation, instead a complex, spicy concoction with caraway and green chile, or a set of fritters (labeled \"baby corn,\" though I'm not at all sure that's what they were) that become transcendent when dipped in one of the array of lovely sauces that they provide. And it's actually spicy, or, rather, many dishes are (the butter chicken is still, predictably, bland and inoffensive), which is damn near impossible to find in an Indian restaurant around these parts--even some of the buffet items have a decent bite. And the little (free!) cups of chai that they provide--strong, but not too sweet, not like the milky sugared-up lattes that you get at Starbucks. And this, and that, and more. Yes, it's slightly spendy (currently around $15 for the buffet), but you don't eat here every day and, perhaps, like me, you've driven for a while to be here, in a weird abandoned parking lot adjacent to a Holiday Inn Express adjacent to a huge tech park... so it's probably worth it.\n\nBut if you've just skipped to the end, here, in hopes of discovering whether this restaurant is good and whether you should eat here, the answer is, definitely, yes and yes. If you are even remotely intrigued by Indian food, and if you do not shrink from the notion of capsaicin-laced food as if it were the machinations of the devil himself, you owe it to yourself to visit this place. Yes, it's in the parking lot of a hotel, and it's tiny, and you don't know where you are or what's what (welcome to Florida). Just go in and eat the goat curry, you weirdo.", "date": "2021-11-27 03:32:54"}

They made a mistake and delivered it immediately after ordering (around 2 pm).  So no big deal....I just told them of their mistake and they took back the pizza.  They delivered it again around 5, and when I say again, I mean the same pizza from 2 pm.  The bottom crust was burnt because they clearly threw it back in the oven for a few minutes to heat it up.  It was stiff as a board and barely warmer than room temperature.  Even if it were my mistake that caused the 2 pm delivery, which it wasn't, this still would have been really poor customer service.", "date": "2021-10-05 21:32:15"}

We visited this location yesterday-May 14 2019-we entered at 2:15p and left at 3:52pm. We were immediately sat by the hostess whom was very friendly and told us about the unlimited games for $1.99 that we had the option to play.\n\nOur waitress/server name was Alesha, she greeted us and took down our order. We received our soups and no breadsticks, Alesha said that there was going to be a wait on the bread sticks, so I started eating my soup but couldn't finish it because I like to dip my breadsticks inside my soup, so I waited a few more minutes and still NO breadsticks. I went to the bathroom and came back and there were no breadsticks still! My drink of a watermelon margarita did come tho' and my drink gave me an instant headache because it tasted as if the bartender had originally made my drink with a salt rim and then noticed that I said no rim and just poured my drink into a different glass-which is why my drink looked the way it did (which was cloudy) and tasted the way it did(which was salty). I didn't want to complain about the drink but I felt as though I needed to tell Alesha because the drink gave me an immediate headache and that's not how that drink is suppose to taste. I was just at the city Ave -Olive Garden and my drink was perfect, clearly something wasNOT  right here. Alesha apologized about the error and brought me a new watermelon margarita drink which was now made to perfection! Thank you Alesha/Alicia for great service!\n\nOur food was good, although my son's fries looked well over cooked, but both of our portions were correct. My son was disappointed with the fact that they didn't have any ketchup for his chicken fingers sadly. \n\nIf there wasn't such a long wait time on the bread sticks and if my original drink didn't give me a headache and if the bathrooms were clean this would of been a 5 star experience because our waitress Alesha was pretty polite and nice to us and even wished me a happy belated Mother's Day.\n\nSomething that also made my son and I and another table of guests shake our heads was the fact that we were waiting for our checks and we heard a different waitress (NOT Alesha) saying to her customers that \" she doesn't eat here, she doesn't bring her family here, and that olive garden's food is not good and she's just being honest that she would rather eat Italian food at a small restaurant that has 3 tables in it because the food here just isn't good to her and that she only works there and repeated that she doesn't eat there\". I understand if you don't like the food where you work at that's fine, but why did the waitress feel the need to advertise that she doesn't like olive garden's food to Olive garden's customers? Even the waitress's guest were like wow you are super honest---honestly it made me feel like ummmm I don't even want my left overs anymore because even the employees here are saying that they don't eat olive garden's food. \n\nSo all in all I had to take away a star for our wait time for bread sticks, bathrooms weren't stocked and were not swept and the fact that I had to hear the other waitress (not my waitress) complaining about how nasty olive gardens food is. I truly wanted my experience at this location to be a \"wow \" experience because of my past experiences at the city Ave location....but the only great things here was my waitress Alesha whom was very inviting and made my son and I feel like family and the hostess who was nice and I did enjoy my food up until I heard the other waitress expressing that she disliked olive garden's food. So my experience at this location was a 3 star experience but my service from my server Alesha was a 5 star! Thanks again Alesha you were great.", "date": "2019-05-15 13:46:07"}

Helm has an open kitchen so you can see the chefs cooking the food. When they weren't cooking we saw them standing around on their phones, and they did not wash their hands in between being on their phones and handling food.  Then when they were preparing our desserts, we watched a chef dip a spoon into the whipped cream tub, lick the spoon, dip it back into the tub, put the whipped cream on one of our desserts, then put the spoon back in his mouth. Needless to say I was unable to eat the dessert and passed it off as being full, but wish I had said something about what we witnessed.

First thing Monday morning, I took the phone back to them and explained the issue, thinking that some type of dirt or dust had blocked the microphone during the charging port replacement.  The representative was attentive and took my phone immediately.  He said it would be approximately 35-40 minutes, so I told him I would come back to pick it up.  When I returned later, the phone was done and they had had to change the charging port again due to the microphone issue.  They did not charge me for it and were very apologetic.  My husband has been using this place for several years now, and this was my first experience.  I will definitely return!  The customer service was above all else and the place was super welcoming and clean inside.  You will not be disappointed!  This is a great spot for your phone/tablet fixes!", "date": "2019-03-25 18:36:19"}

I have tried them out because of my concerns of the social distancing precautions with COVID 19.  I am pleased to say that I feel that Trader Joe's is the clear winner of all of them with Social Distancing precautions because they make people wait outside and limit the number of shoppers in the store at once, they spray hand sanitizer on every shopper's hands upon entering, they wipe down carts and the checkout line is controlled, not amassed.  I have felt more safe shopping here than anywhere else for that reason.  In case you're wondering, DiBruno's came in 2nd tied with VIP Market and well, we can guess who came in last because of not practicing social distancing.  There are many other ways to compare these markets, but my analysis is based on my experience with Social Distancing precautions.\n\nThey have lots of fresh produce, a nice plant selection, great prepared meals, snacks, a nice selection of frozen foods and it's at a fraction of the price of the other markets.  \n\nThe store is clean, the employees are very helpful and friendly!

The sauce was pretty great as well. We were both really full after eating our meals so we actually go dessert to go. We got the Ricotta Cheesecake and the Bourbon Pound cake.

We booked a stay in Sept. 2018 for a stay in middle of Oct.  When we arrived we were disappointed by the place immediately.  The pictures looked so much better.  The pool area looked distressed and was closed.  There was no one at the outdoor pool bar but the bartender.   We had to go up an outdoor elevator which was very hot inside to get to the reception area.  I asked about the pool and they said it was closed for rennovation and that they were \"sorry\". \n  I became very upset because we had a small child and there was no pool and they knew this as this rennovation was scheduled.  They offered us a few drink tickets to compensate - big deal!  I told them my grandaughter doesn't drink.  I talked to them two times before making a reservation and no one mentioned the pool rennovation.   The room was very far away from the hot elevator.  So although the view of the Gulf was nice it was a quite a hike to get to it from our room. You could tell there were efforts to update the older building but it just quite did not meet my expectations of what I thought an hotel being connected to the Don CeSar hotel would be like.   The couch had some light stains on it and gave me the creeps.  The other two pieces off furniture were dated rattan furniture.  The one chair pad had a light round stain on it like it had been peed on.  I asked calmly to talk to the manager and of course he was \"not available\".    So I called him and left a message and Rick never returned my call.   So for that I write this not so great review.", "date": "2018-11-01 00:39:19"}

In any event, after consulting with my wife we decided to take a stroll over to Nudoru Ramen, a place we've seen on many an outing but often passed by for one reason or another. We were seated quickly and the waitress was very pleasant, although mildly flustered by how busy things were. There were just two servers the aforementioned waitress and another waiter, of the two of them the waitress seemed to do most of the work of serving people. \n\nThe menus were simple, a few tapas items, some soups, specialty ramen, and a \"make-your-own\" ramen menu. We both went with a the meat based broth with a shoyu style flavour. I topped mine with pork belly, 1/2 a soft boiled egg, menma bamboo shoots, and sweet corn. The orders came out quickly, and promptly. The broth was still very hot, all the flavours were present. \n\nI'll preface the rest of my review with this statement, for Edmonton this is a solid Ramen bar (not a jab at Edmonton by any means). The reason I say this is because I've been spoiled by ramen restaurants where there is more variety and competition to push restaurants to try to achieve more to stand out from the crowd. \n\nAs far as the taste of my ramen was, it had a strong shoyu (soy sauce based) taste. The noodles were a bit chewy for my liking, and the soft boiled egg had a distinct salty taste that over powered everything in that bite. The bamboo shoots weren't as firm as I had expected but they were fine given the rest of the dish. The pork belly was the saving grace of this ramen dish, as it was flavourful with good texture and softness that it melted in my mouth. \n\nAfter we were finished with our meal it took a while for us to get the bill and pay. \n\nWould I go back? Probably, if I were craving ramen. Would it be my first choice? It's still up in the air for me (my wife said she wouldn't come back anytime soon). So take this review for what it may be. As far as ramen restaurants in Edmonton goes, it's a place you should at very least visit to see for yourself. If you have had ramen in any part of Asia or more specifically Japan, you will probably be let down. Happy eating!", "date": "2018-04-15 04:18:24"}

My family often went to tea at the tea room that occupied the building before Black Cat Cafe opened, so I was interested to see what replaced it. Black Cat Cafe is operated by a non-profit organization that supports pet rescue and is run by volunteers- and all meals are tax-free. We made reservations for 12:30 on a Saturday. During our meal, there were only about 4 tables occupied, and a few empty- it would be safe to stop in here on Saturdays without a reservation. The decor was cute and they had tons of pictures of cats and dogs around the cafe.\n\nWe were seated right away, but weren't given menus and our table wasn't set. The couple next to us handed us their menus and said, \"here- we don't need these anymore\". (Their food came in the next 5-10 minutes, so I think the waitress forgot to pick the menus up from their table). The good surprise: they were serving breakfast, and they had some great vegetarian and vegan options as well. Eventually a waitress came by and asked us what drinks we wanted- we all ordered iced teas, which were really good. When she brought them a bit later, she forgot to give us straws or spoons- I had to ask. Eventually she took our food order. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. It took about an hour from the time we sat down until our food arrived. (Except for soup- one of the 3 of us ordered soup, and that came out about 20 minutes before the rest of our food). However, once the food came out, it was pretty tasty. We had to be somewhat aggressive to get things we needed- more iced tea, ketchup, etc. However, in the end, everything tasted good, and everything was quite cheap ($27 for 3 people). \n\nI'd come back again for the food, and if the service improved a bit, this would easily be a 5-star place. On the way out, we quickly browsed their shop area- they had some items you could buy to support the SPCA (t-shirts, mugs, keychains, etc.) and some yummy looking scones and brownies. Apparently when it is nicer out, they also have adoption days where they bring dogs and cats out to the site for you to spend time with before or after your meal (and consider adopting, of course!).\n\nPros: supports a great non-profit, tax-free dining, cheap tasty food, cute cafe, not overly crowded, vegan/vegetarian options\nCons: slow, spotty service", "date": "2012-02-12 01:46:26"}

If you're looking for a chic, unique dinner, look no further.

Austin described it as \"meat butter\" and turns out there is not a more accurate descriptor than that. A unique, smokey buttery flavor served in alarmingly large femur bones, the marrow was more of a special delicacy, but certainly worth the experience.\nMy dining partner hit it out of the park with an order of gnocchi, creamy and well seasoned. The portion was small, but as someone who rarely orders non-meat entrees, he was floored by the flavor of this dish. \nI ordered the peach and ham pizza, which was quite good, though paled in comparison to the gnocchi. The pricing was very disproportionate to the amount of food, though quite in line with quality since my pizza was at least 2 meals but not quite on par for deliciousness with the gnocchi.\nDrinks were also impressive once we got past the overwhelming array of nuanced cocktails (good, just a bit confusing at first glance). I went with a beehive, refreshing and tasty!\nFinally, the cookie skillet....I mean, just wow! A warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla gelato.

The place is obviously really nice, but it's not $800 a night nice. The hotel is more like a camp ground setting with all the rooms in different buildings with gardens around, quite tranquille.  I decided to walk and find the swimming pool in my robe....I ended up having to cross the main road to get there, a bit embarrassing for cars driving past.\n\nEverything was really over priced there. I made the mistake of thinking I could walk into Santa Barbara...which you can't. It's a 15 min taxi away which was a bit annoying.\n\nANYWAY...to the point..a celebrity was staying there who I randomly ran into during my self tour of the complex.....as I was just looking at what was going on, I was ushered out of the grounds by staff! When I told the staff I was staying there they didn't believe me and then followed me around! It was SO RUDE. Once they realized I did have a room there I was followed back to my room. I felt like I was under ROOM ARREST as they waited outside, what did they think I was going to do? Do you realize how much I have spent there! Now I didn't say anything to the celeb or do anything to them or even take any pictures, I just simply watched what was going on inside the hotel that I had paid to stay in.\n\nI get it you are an OVER PRICED HOTEL for people with 'more money than sense'  Does this mean my stay is worth less than someone else's? DISGUSTED\n\nI didn't like any of the stuck up staff, I didn't feel relaxed which was my entire purpose for going there in the first place and I have told so many people about that incident! I had a beer on the veranda but felt like I was being watched so just left to go into town (15 minutes away) I had planned on staying 3 nights....and ended up checking out after 1 as I was so mad!\n\nGet a grip!

I actually haven't been to any movie theatre for several years so when we showed up 5 minutes early for a 1:50 matinee on a Saturday, and were told the only seats left were front row my immediate response was a silent but mental HUH??? Verbally I actually asked \"do you assign seats\"?  The look I got was priceless. Yes. I had no idea how much theaters had changed. \n\nFront row scared me. I bought tickets for the following day and chose a back row seat. I walked away on Saturday armed with the website, www.galaxytheatres.com, where I will be able to locate my local Legends theatre and buy tickets in the future. \n\nNOTE that there is a $1.50 surcharge to buy tickets online. Bumps the matinee (& evening Senior) price from $8.50 to $10. But hey...ELECTRIC RECLINING SEATS and swing away tray tables...Plenty of space to walk down each isle with all the seats reclined!  And an excellent well designed wheelchair row with companion seating. And good safety lighting along the stairs. \n\nThe next time we go...and we WILL be back...I will check out the view from that front row just in case we don't want to plan far ahead to see a movie!\n\nAnd a note to management...I agree this is a luxury theatre  but if Galaxy ever wants to take luxury to the ultimate level, CONSIDER OFFERING ORGANIC POPCORN or at the very least NON GMO popcorn!  I would buy THAT popcorn!  And it would say a lot for a Theatre to take an interest in its customers health!  \n\nOther reviews have mentioned that IMAX does NOT have reclining seats.

You're immediately greeted by the pit/preparation area as you enter the premises. You can smell the flavor of the food outside the building! My mouth was watering before I came through the door. I went with my wife who had been here before and recommended I try it. Spoiler alert! This place is hands-down some of the best BBQ I've ever had. \n\nIt was a Sunday night, so it wasn't too crowded. Though the upstairs section had a lot of people sitting there. Due to COVID we decided to sit in the less populated section inside, but downstairs. There is also seating outside, both upstairs and downstairs. We were greeted by our server, and handed a carafe of water and two glasses. I ordered a Pepsi, and looked at the menu. \n\nI was glad to see that they had just about every BBQ aficionado's pick of meats. There's pulled-pork, ribs, brisket, beef-rib, and the list goes on. I was a little disappointed in the Pepsi/Coke choice, but that's a personal preference, and not a point off for the restaurant. If Dr. BBQ is paying homage to Texas, then he would get an extra point for staying true to Dr. Pepper in fact. I ended up ordering the Texas Two-Step which offers two half portions of meats, and two sides for $18. \n\nThe food came on a sheet pan with parchment paper on top, which was a nice touch. The sides I ordered, the cowboy caviar, and fries, came in their own respective dishes. Presentation was good, and I enthusiastically started to eat. The burnt ends! Oh, they were perfect. Just the right amount of softness to crunchiness ratio if that is even a thing. The ends of the ends were slightly burnt, and the crunchy part of the ends was my favorite part. There was so much flavor in the meat (angus beef) that I didn't even need one of their three BBQ sauces to go with it. I can't rave enough about the burnt ends; just get them. Secondly, I bit into the brisket, first without sauce, and then I proceeded to try all three sauces. The brisket was cooked perfectly, and was soft and tender. The first sauce, the sweet sauce, was a little too sweet for my taste. The other two sauces, the Smokey, and the Spicy sauces were delicious. The spicy sauce ended up being my favorite. It had just the right amount of heat, and flavor, that it paired with the brisket perfectly. \n\nNow for the sides. The Cowboy Caviar was a little disappointing. It was bland with no seasonings, and there was no heat to it. I would suggest adding some kind of salt-based seasoning, and a few jalape\u00f1os to kick it up a few levels. I almost took a star off for this side, but it is nothing that can't be easily remedied, and the other two sides I tasted, the BBQ beans, and self-cut fries, more than made up for it. Side-note, I did end up finishing the Cowboy Caviar as it was still a good side. The fries were seemingly done in house. I've never seen fires cut in these shapes, and they tasted fresh, not frozen. The fries are also super thin, so they are almost like potato chips, but not quite. The BBQ beans were awesome! Full of flavor, and just the right amount of sweetness. It even had pieces of meat in there for added flavor. \n\nService was good. I did have to wait a few minutes for a refill on my Pepsi, but that could've been specific to my server. She may have been very busy upstairs, as the downstairs indoors wasn't very busy. I ended up eating everything but the toast, and two burnt ends, and that's saying something because they were so good I wanted to eat them. I then decided to see what they had for dessert. I ordered the Banana Pudding. The pudding was so good that I had to finish it. There were little cookies throughout the pudding, and it was topped with whip cream, and a slice of banana. \n\nOverall, Dr. BBQ is a MUST to visit if you come to the Tampa Bay region. I live 40 minutes away, and would come here every week if I could afford to both physically and monetarily.", "date": "2020-09-28 14:35:17"}

I simply could not ignore the relentless 5-star reviews any longer. Turns out, this place earns every pixel of the full five stars, and even makes me dream of a mythical sixth star. Places like this simply do not exist on the beach.\n\nThe exterior is very unassuming, which helps keep this place off the radar of a lot of folks. The interior is lush with dark woods and perfect attention to design, with the chef's station right out there with the customers. I felt a little underdressed actually, in my t-shirt and shorts (though in no way unwelcome). A woman played live jazz on a small stage in the corner.\n\nThe only slight hiccup in an otherwise perfect experience was the host. When he seated us, he immediately said \"our mineral water choices are ____ and ____, do you have any preference\" as he was walking to grab them for us. An obviously pushy tactic to upsell some drinks right off the bat.

It was one of the nicest, most intimate meals that we have had together in a restaurant. The chef, Jackie, adds a full star by her presence alone. She made sure we were pleased with each dish, told stories from her life as a chef, and really added to the experience. She cooks everything right there, out in the open, a few feet away - giving you the feeling of eating in her own kitchen.\n\nIt is rare when I feel that 5 stars is \"undercutting\" a restaurant. The fact that this place exists at all on the beach is an anomaly. None of the clotted grease, deep-fried goods, or oversized drinks in giant plastic souvenir glasses here!

I was not crazy enough to go back for a third visit. However, I was brought a red velvet cupcake.  The entire edge of the cupcake was hard, and last time I checked cupcakes are supposed to be moist. The inside of the cupcake was dry, and no amount of frosting could save this cupcake from its desert wasteland. Sprinkles cupcakes and many others have nothing to worry about. This business is going to need to put in some serious work to stick around.", "date": "2009-03-10 18:52:40"}

Only moments later, we found ourselves reaching for a fresh pretzel... unreal! A few free samples later, and we decided that nothing cures a hangover like Thai food. For $5.50 each, we got a generous helping of spicy shrimp curry (amazingly flavorful and spicy!) and veggie pad thai (honestly, the veggie pad thai didn't do it for me - not moist enough). For another $2, we were gulping the very best shrimp tom yum soup. It was partly sticker shock from non-NYC prices and partly the outrageously flavorful food... but I'm hooked on Reading Terminal Market! On the way out, we picked up a whoopie pie and a cinnamon bun from the Amish bakery... both very good, but not quite as surprising as the pretzel.

But  pizza is one of Italian cuisine and this restaurant needs a improvement as soon as possible because they ruined Italian food and I love this casino but I am dissatisfied and disappointed that this restaurant is not good and they will never offer pizza in fine dining and they should because they have a oven I think that the manger is very mean and doesn't understand that customer would want pizza in fine dining restaurant but not this restaurant they only serve pizza at biscottis but that's not Italian restaurant it's American it's just not good I don't recommend going to this restaurant. Like i said they ruined Italian food and Italian restaurant Entirely. When I will stay at the Peppermill casino resort i will never go to this restaurant ever again because they won't serve pizza I won't eat here at this restaurant ever again because they won't serve pizza at this Italian restaurant I won't go to this restaurant. I hope that the manger or the food and beverage management see this and understand that I won't change my review because they won't add pizza to their fine dining!. And I can't stand that a nice resort like Peppermill won't offer pizza in fine dining that is highly  Ridiculous that they put a Italian restaurant and they don't have a pizza on the menu just because they won't allow it they should because This Italian restaurant has a oven it's not hard to add pizza on the menu. And it's even more  Ridiculous that they only serve it in Biscotti cafe and deli that's is absolutely Horrendous that they won't even do what guest want restaurant to improve and they won't do it even if they have Wood fired oven that is Ridiculous and fish is not a Italian cuisine it's seafood restaurant. And it's really sucks that this hotel resort casino ruined Italian food entirely and they will make more and more guest upset and still they won't listen what guest want and pretty soon a lot of guest will stop coming this restaurant forever because it's ridiculous and horrible that they bring the worst Italian restaurant experience to guest I love pizza and they can easily to Neapolitan Italian pizza it's not hard to do and this restaurant sucks and the management team manger for this restaurant is horribly  rude and won't fix this problem and I will keep this review until they fix this fine dining issue and add pizza. All I want is more people to vote that my review is most helpful I want enough people to vote most helpful so that they will make this happen and fix this problem immediately. Or else I am going to send a email to Anthony Melchiorri to fly down to Reno neveda and put a new season and fix this problem because he is more mean then me and he will definitely make this hotel better and make the menu more guest friendly. Please kind people who do agree with me that this problem needs to be fix ASAP. I hope everyone understand what other guest and me are going through. More people vote the sooner this problem can be resolved. It's just ridiculous that a resort won't offer pizza in fine dining that is a Ridiculous rule they have in the Peppermill casino. And this restaurant disgusted me and the people who is head of team of this restaurant. And people complain this restaurant doesn't open until five that is Ridiculous. And I think I will definitely send a email to Anthony Melchiorri to fix this hotel resort casino ASAP?. Because this hotel really messed up Italian restaurant. It's clear to me that they don't pay the employees very well and the chef so they decided to save money and the only way they had to do this is to not offer pizza in the menu because it would make the pizza expensive on the menu and it would give Much money to the employees and not to the restaurant what heard when you sign  the check it doesn't go to the employees it goes to the restaurant and that is  ridiculous behavior that this hotel have someone needs to have a serious talk with owners and fix this hotel entirely.

Purchased many guns, ammo, and supplies from them. Brought my wife and 10 year old daughter neither of whom have ever held or shot a handgun before. I informed the guy at the desk I wasn't there to shoot but teach my wife and daughter how to safely handle and shoot a handgun. He asked me if I was an instructor (not sure of the relevance). I told him no. For the record I have over 40 years of weapons experience as well as a substantial amount of advanced weapons training. I was only charged for my wife and daughter. We went in and set up on the lane and I instructed my daughter on how to handle the weapon and site the target. She was obviously nervous because this was her first time shooting. She asked me to fire the weapon so she could see what to expect. I fired ONE round downrange to show her what to expect and set the weapon down and was getting ready for her to step up and begin. Less than a minute went by when a range officer tapped me on the shoulder and told me I needed to step out and pay a range fee because I'd fired the weapon. I asked the range officer if I could clear the weapon because he was so insistent that I needed to pay. He said ok. I had to leave my wife and daughter on the range to go pay. We had a civil exchange at the counter where I explained why I had fired ONE round. He had no interest in what I had to say. I asked to speak to a supervisor whose position was the same. I then asked to speak to the store manager with the same result. None of the three gentlemen I spoke with had any interest in what I had to say. They simply wanted to collect their range fee. The second gentleman I spoke to interjected that they made an exception even allowing me onto the range without paying. Something I find odd as I've trained others there before. They lost a valued customer and will lose my brother in law as well over a $16 range fee. Shame on them. I'm not saying rules are made to broken, because they are not, however, charging someone for firing one round to show a 10 year old what to expect is truly ridiculous.", "date": "2017-08-14 02:34:10"}

I came here with three friends for a wind down on a Thursday night.  Our waitress (whose name was also Kate, or something very similar) walked us through the menu, didn't groan when we tried to order things which weren't on tap at the moment (things cycle through based on availability, but there is a board in the back which lists everything they have at the moment, and they're described super helpfully in the menu).  She managed to lead us all down our own beer path successfully finding something for everyone.  Also, she seemed to have had everything on the menu and stopped us from making some questionable decisions from a place of overwhelmed confusion.\n\nIn short, our waitress/bartender made the night, but the nice, warm, welcoming atmosphere didn't hurt.

To their doctor, that must have translated into me saying my vision changed and I need a whole new prescription.   His chair-side manner was terrible, he doesn't speak much to his patients, nor does he listen.  As a result he informed me that one of my eyes had gotten better, and wrote me a new prescription.\n\nSince Visionworks, like most other places like it charge a fortune for lenses, I went to get my glasses made at a different store, Lecso (whom I very highly recommend).  When I put them on I suddenly had double vision, a headache, pressure on my eye and I couldn't see or even read anything. \n\nI then returned to Visionworks demanding they fix this prescription right away.  The same doctor did a 2 second exam and then told me that he \"GUESSED\" that my vision had gotten better than it really had, and so he wrote another prescription.\n\nI now had to pay for another pair of glasses to be made because apparently guessing is now part of optometry.  Despite my experience so far I was confident it would be right this time.  I was wrong.  I tried to wear this pair for a few days in an attempt to get used to them, and as a result I had horrible headaches every single day I had them on.  One day my headache was so intense I had to miss work.  \n\nSo I called Visionworks to explain to them what I had been through, and demand to see a different doctor.  After being placed on hold for about 10 minutes I finally got an appointment with someone else.  When that day came (my 10:45 appointment was actually 11:00 apparently), I got to see a far more competent doctor, who actually listened.  He started my exam with my existing lenses and from there tried to see if my vision could get better.  It didn't, because as I initially suspected, my vision has not changed!!!  \n\nThis was not the first time that the same doctor that I saw twice at the beginning of this ordeal has messed up my prescription.  A few years ago, when he released my prescription for contact lenses, he wrote the magnification as 180, when it was actually supposed to be 80.  That was a $300 mistake that I had to pay for.  I had enough and complained to the store manager, who then thought it was acceptable to tell me that all of this was MY FAULT!!!\n\nI will never go to Visionworks again, and I strongly recommend nobody else does either.  I plan to go to a real optometrist who has his own practice, not a store in the local shopping mall.  \n\nLesson Learned!", "date": "2014-07-22 17:04:25"}

I was upset at first I had to bring him in again as he is always more comfortable at home, but I did.  Then Mohamed and I decided that the best thing to do would be a ultrasound to get a better look of the inside and to see if he was going to be going into hepatic lipidosis.

Had dinner there on Saturday night, first time for my husband to go there. We had dinner entrees, and they were more satisfying that what I had ordered in the past. He got the Bayou Shrimp, with 5 large shrimp and a very thin crawfish etouffe sauce, and a hunk of savory bread pudding, over spinich. Beautifully presented. I had the chicken coatted and rolled with polenta and served with a porcini mushroom gravy, over cubed potatoes, with roasted asparagus. Also beautifully presented.\n\nHusband loved the shrimp, which was very spicy (maybe too spicy for me). He also liked the spinach and the bread pudding. I did not care for the taste of the polenta as a crust, however, and it was also rolled inside it, I think mixed with the mushrooms there. But that may have been my own taste buds, or maybe it was not a good creation. The chicken was moist and tender, and the potatoes were satisfying. Too much dinner for me to finish. \n\nNonetheless, we ordered dessert. I couldn't resist the sound of the ho-made ice cream--banana, walnut, chocolate hunk. Very delicious. My husband got the apple strudel with ice cream, and he enjoyed it as well.\n\nBy the way, our bread was very fresh and delicious. I saw women dining (without men), and they seemed to be having a very good time, so may \"Nicholas\" (see patt C. 5/7/2013) was working that night. All the staff were so very nice, they had been trained to smile and be polite as is allowable by the law to the guests.\n\nI will say, Jimmy's was NOT doing a full business--the Oyster Bar and something else up the street seemed to be overflowing.

Becht said they would reimburse me. I imagine they did - moving was so chaotic I didn't check my bank statement that month and forgot to follow up. But they really screwed me over, since then I had to call off work to get the deep cleaning done myself last minute just a few days before move out. \n\nBecause of this, I will never ever ever hire Becht again, honestly even if they fired everyone since then, because just thinking about them makes me mad.", "date": "2021-08-11 21:37:47"}

This review is for Restaurant Week, Fall 2012...and Restaurant Week, Winter 2011, and dinner, and lunch, and every time in between that I visited the 'buzzo.\n\nBarbuzzo simply does not mess up, ever. Let's get right to why: my Restaurant Week meal began with two crispy, thin two-bite flatbreads: one with salted radish and another with tomato, basil, olive oil, and balsamic. Both were perfection; the tomato bread in particular hit a perfect balance between the sweet/savory notes of the tomato, the body of the olive oil, and the texture/saltiness of the edible accomplices. \n\nFrom there, I progressed to the sheep's milk ricotta. I'm not *dons internet flame body armor* a huge fan of cheese *takes armor off*, but this stuff is the truth. The ricotta is light, creamy, and subtly sweet without any of the typical \"this tastes like bad breath smells\" vibes that most cheeses communicate to my tongue. As others have said, however, the bread and the sherry figs do the real damage here, with the latter enhancing the aforementioned subtle sweetness of the cheese and the former being an crispy, oil-infused, appetizer-worthy force in and of itself. The smokiness of the bread takes the dish in a much more daring direction than less talented chefs would ever attempt. Subtle but significant touches like plus flawless execution that are what make Barbuzzo clinch that fifth star.\n\nNext up was the Paccheri, which is similar to the Calabrese on the ordinary menu. Both are pork ragu rigatoni dishes that are heavy on the basil and show just how devastating a perfectly-honed simplicity can be. Unlike most 'buzzo fans, I think the Budino is merely good as opposed to THE HARDEST OUT, so I went for the Tiramisu instead. I'm really not a dessert person, but I was able to kill this one without much of a problem, which is saying a lot. \n\nNormally, I'd end the review right there, but I really need to stress to the casuals that you're missing out if you only try the Restaurant Week menu. There are at least five other pitch-perfect dishes on the menu here (the stuffed meatballs and the uovo pizza being the very best of them) with a balanced drink selection to match, if that's your thing. I really don't have a witty, jokey, negative, or cynical thing to say about this place - oh yes I do, actually. It's a claustrophobe's nightmare, both due to the crowdedness and the narrowness of the space. You'll totally suffocate and die and go to Awesome Food Hell before you finish your meal. You might be even forced to, I don't know, rub elbows with and interact with strangers! The horror! So yeah, terrible job, Barbuzzo. I hereby revoke my five stars. Except I don't.", "date": "2012-10-12 19:59:01"}

The crust is thin and crispy, the sauce is excellent and they put just the perfect amount of cheese.  We used to love going there, getting a plain Neapolitan pie and then some specialty slices but the parking can be very challenging during Friday nights.  Much to my elation, and with help from Yelp, I recently learned that they will deliver to our house in Aston. I have had their Sicilian crust also and really like it; it reminds me of my Grand Mom's home made pizza.  Unfortunately I am the only one I my house that likes Sicilian and you can't eat a whole one so I grab a slice  when I see it behind the counter.  Their tomato pie is also very good as is their stuffed pizza.  I particularly enjoy the one stuffed with steak meat & cheese (comes with Marinara sauce for dipping) which I have gotten from behind the counter but it apparently is not on the menu.", "date": "2017-08-18 23:00:07"}

After getting my cash back from Rite Aid I decided to treat myself to some Micky Ds breakfast. I figured a coffee, hash brown and a bacon egg and cheese bagel would help the hangover that was slowly taking over my body.\n\nI got in the crazy long line that snaked around the store, confused as to why a \"fast\" food joint would have such a long line. Well after about 10 minutes the line hadn't moved because out of the two cashiers one  was standing at the register glaring at the customers and the other was playing with her hair. A little angry I asked if there was a problem with the register since neither of them seemed to know how to do their jobs - surprise, no response. After another 10 minutes it was almost my turn with only one order ahead of me. Two middle school kids were in line before me and the cashier refused to take their order and instead told them \"go back to school and take your exams\". I was shocked. I have never seen anyone refuse an order before. Little did the ignorant cashier know that they were also here on vacation and were sent in by their parents who were waiting in the car. Apparently the drive through line was longer and more stagnant than the one inside - hard to believe. They walked out empty handed. \n\nWhen it was finally my turn to order the cashier didn't say a thing and just stared at me. I said hello and she responded with a blank stare. Tired of waiting I told her my order. She wasn't listening and made me repeat it. I tried to order one of their breakfast meals without the coffee. She didn't seem to grasp that concept and gave me the coffee anyway. Instead of trying to correct my order I gave it to one of the homeless men who was waiting outside. \n\nI have never seen such poor customer service before.
